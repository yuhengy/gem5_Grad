This is the DESCRIPTION of this manual(coming soon :))


==Chapter 1 System Introduction==
:This chapter introduces how to startup the system and describes the system interface, and also introduces the system tool bar in detail.
===System Startup===
:You can startup the system using any of the following methods:
:1.	Double click the InteriCAD T5 shortcut on the WINDOWS desktop.
:2.	Select Program from start menu, and then YFCAD Software/InteriCAD T5.

===System Interface===
:The system startup window looks as follows:

=====2D Design Interface=====
:
:
:
:*'''Menu Bar''': Where software commands are placed, you can use them by clicking the left mouse button.
:*'''Tool Bar''': Where most common commands are placed, you can use them by clicking the left mouse button.
:*'''Workplace''': The specific area to construct drawing.

=====Introduction to Yuan Fang VR Interface=====
:
:*'''Menu Bar''': Where software commands are placed, you can use them by clicking the left mouse button.
:*'''Tool Bar''': Where most common commands are placed, you can use them by clicking the left mouse button.
:*'''Workplace''': The specific area to construct drawing.
:*'''Command Window''': Where you can input commands.
:*'''Status Bar''': Display cursor, coordinate and mode status.
=====Modeling Design Interface=====
:
:*'''Menu Bar''': Where software commands are placed, you can use them by clicking the left mouse button.
:*'''Tool Bar''': Where most common commands are placed, you can use them by clicking the left mouse button.
:*'''Drawing Window''': The area you construct drawing. The system defaults into four-view form. The one in the left upper corner is front view, in the left lower corner is top view, in the right upper corner is side view, and in the right lower corner is isometric view.
:*'''Command Window''': Where you can input command.
:*'''Status Bar''': Display cursor coordinate and mode status.
:*'''Construction Graph Screen Menu''': Most common Construction Graph commands.

==Chapter 2 2D Design==
===Interface===
:The interface of 2D design is shown as below: 
:
:The interface includes:
:'''Menu''': All commands can be found in menu
:'''Toolbar''': Shortcut icons of main commands can be found
:'''Design Wizard''': Showing the steps of design 
:'''Drawing space''': Where you can draw the floor plan 
:'''Furniture library''': includes Yuan Fang system library and manufacturer’s customized library. Left click to unfold each category and call certain piece of furniture

===Common Operation===
:*Usage of the Mouse
::'''Left click''': Most commands are accomplished by left click. For example: selecting pull-down menu, clicking icon on toolbar and etc. 
::'''Right click''': Some commands are ended by right click. For any existing object, right click it and the edit command will be shown.
::Note: No matter what command is being executed, right click and the command will exit.  
:*Two Operation Rules
::Rule No.1: Select command first. Then follow the prompt to execute further operation. 
::Rule No.2: Select object first. Then right click, and the exclusive edit menu towards the selected object will be shown. Note: every object has its unique edit menu. This menu cannot be found in the tool bar.

===File Menu===
:*New File
::Create a new drawing file.
::'''Basic operations''':Click '''''File / New''''' in menu bar.
::'''Note''': If any changes have been made to the current file, the system will ask you whether to save it. Click Yes, the system will save the file. If it is a new file, the file will be saved as a new file.Click No, the system will open a new file without saving the current file.If Cancel, the system will not open a new file.

==Chapter 10 Online Cloud Library==
Online Cloud Library is a brand new system developped by YFCAD, aiming to provide more efficient customized modeling service to individual users. <br/>
Online Modeling Service contains 3 parts: Make Model, Check Model, and Recharge.
:•	Make Model. This is for submitting model information. 
:•	Check Model. This is for checking the progress of modeling. Users can also send their feedbacks about the model to YFCAD.
:•	Recharge. This is for the basic cost of the service.
===Basic Operations:===
=====Part1: Make Model=====
=====Part2: Check Model=====
=====Part3: Recharge=====
