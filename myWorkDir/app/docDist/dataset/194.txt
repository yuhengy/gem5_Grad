As of 2014, Germany is the world’s leader in solar energy production.<ref>Wheeland, M. (2014). Top 10 countries using solar power. ''Pure Energies''. http://pureenergies.com/</ref>  Germany’s solar journey started in the 1980s when the country was still heavily dependent on fossil fuels and nuclear energy (fig. 1). [[File:Electricity Production in Germany.svg|thumb|Figure 1. Electricity production in Germany]] Due to disruptions in the fossil fuel supply and nuclear disasters, German communities started to independently adopt solar energy.  While the solar movement began in the 1980s, the government took action in 2000 with the [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Lentis/Solar_Energy_Policy_in_Germany&stable=0#The_Renewable_Energy_Act Renewable Energy Act].  This movement affected the productivity of conventional and nuclear energy companies, while allowing new solar companies to enter the energy industry.  This chapter discusses the history that led to the Renewable Energy Act and its implications, along with the key participants in this movement.

== History of Energy in Germany ==

[[File:Germany.jpg|thumb| Figure 2. Germany's energy demand per capita compared to world and Eurasian averages (data from Google Analytics)]]

In 2012, Germany was the eighth largest consumer of energy in the world, and the largest in Europe.<ref name= "U.S. Energy">[U.S. Energy Information Administration. ''Germany''. (2013). http://www.eia.gov.]</ref> Germany has consistently remained atop the world and Eurasian averages in energy consumption over the last 20 years (fig. 2). Germany still ranks fourth in coal and eighth in petroleum worldwide, despite decreased demand of those two resources by 35.7% and 15.6% respectively since 1991.<ref name="U.S. Energy" /> Germany depends on coal, nuclear, and petroleum for its energy needs.

The anti-nuclear movement in Germany began in the 1970s in the village of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyhl Wyhl], where the locals prevented the construction of a nuclear plant.<ref name="Morris, C.">[Morris, C. (2013). ''Welcome to the energiewende''. http://welcometotheenergiewende.blogspot.de]</ref> This protest incited German communities to demand more sustainable sources of energy. Spurred by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster Chernobyl] catastrophe in April of 1986, which caused radioactive rain in Germany, the majority of the public opposed nuclear energy. The opposition only grew, with recent polls showing 75-80% of Germans wanting to abandon this energy source.<ref name="Hockenos">[Hockenos, P. (2012). Germany's renewable energy gamble. ''E: The Environmental Magazine, ''23(5), 28-33. Academic Search Complete.]</ref>

The oil crises of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis 1973] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_energy_crisis 1979] made Germany implement daylight savings time and a driving ban on Sundays. The crisis also forced Germans to think about alternative energy supply. In 1976, Germany passed the Energy Conservation Act, requiring building insulation. In 1982, Germany forced oil firms to sell unleaded gasoline, getting rid of leaded gas altogether in 2000.<ref name="Morris" />

== ''Energiewende''==
German for energy transition, ''Energiewende'' is a movement that began in the 1980s as an attempt to move away from nuclear energy and 
towards renewables.<ref> German plans to cut carbon emissions with renewable energy are ambitious, but they are also risky (2012, Jul 28). ''The Economist.'' http://www.economist.com/node/21559667.</ref>  According to the [http://www.boell.de/en Heinrich Böll Foundation], the term ''Energiewende'' was first mentioned in the [http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/prj/for/for/en1047589.htm German Institute for Applied  Ecology's] 1980 study, which promoted energy efficiency for economic growth.<ref name="Morris">[Morris, C., Pehnt, M. (2014). ''Energy Transition.'' Landgrebe, D., Jungjohann, A., & Bertram, R. (Eds.).  http://energytransition.de/]</ref> Local, community-driven efforts after the Chernobyl disaster led to the rise of solar power.

== Key Participants ==
Figure 3 shows the key participants of the solar energy movement. [[File:Participants.jpg|thumb|Figure 3. Key participants of Germany's solar energy movement.]]
===Local Cooperatives===
The solar industry continuously grew with German communities' adoption of solar technology. Some German cities, such as Feldheim and Freiburg, became 100% reliant on renewable energy sources, primarily solar and wind.<ref name="Hockenos" />

The unsung hero of Germany's solar movement is a retired general named Wolf von Fabeck, a nature lover from Aachen, Germany.<ref name="Johnstone">[Johnstone, B. (2011). The unsung hero of Germany’s solar miracle. ''Greentechsolar''. http://www.greentechmedia.com] </ref> In response to the Chernobyl catastrophe, von Fabeck pursued solar energy. Along with seven friends, including the pastor of his church, von Fabeck founded the Solar Energy Supporters Association of Aachen.<ref name="Morris, C." />

=== Solar Energy Supporters Association of Aachen ===
Conventional energy sources had a competitive advantage over solar energy at the time. However, the group realized that any investor in a solar energy could feed the extra energy produced back to the grid. According to Wolf von Fabeck: “The main idea was that private owners of solar systems should be treated exactly as if they were utilities.”<ref name="Johnstone" /> This method, now known as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed-in_tariff feed-in-tariff], can make the initial cost of a solar system bearable. Thanks to efforts by grassroots groups, it was adopted in small towns across Germany.

=== Schönau Power Supply (EWS) ===
After Chernobyl, in Schönau, Germany, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_Sladek Ursula] and Michael Sladek formed the Parents for a Nuclear-Free Germany coalition.<ref name = "Nuclear-Free">[Nuclear-Free Future Award Foundation (2014). ''Ursula u. Michael Sladek/EWS''. http://www.nuclear-free-future.com/en/award-presentation/laureates/ursula-u-michael-sladekews]/</ref>  Along with other Schönau residents, the Sladeks bought a local electricity grid and founded the Schönau Power Supply (EWS).<ref>EWS (n.d.). ''History''. http://www.ews-schoenau.de/ews/geschichte.html</ref>  Michael Sladek describes the success of EWS in 1999: “With a small advertising campaign, we have already sold a million kilowatt hours of power across Germany… For the most part it goes to the advancement and improvement of the environmentally friendly power production.”<ref name = "Nuclear-Free" />

=== Government ===
The federal government responded favorably to community efforts by passing the [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Lentis/Solar_Energy_Policy_in_Germany&stable=0#The_Renewable_Energy_Act Renewable Energy Act] in 2000, which incorporated von Fabeck’s feed-in-tariff. However, in 2010, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel Chancellor Merkel] extended the life of nuclear power plants, as she believed that nuclear energy was still vital to Germany’s energy needs.<ref>DW (2014). Deutsche Welle.

Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung. ''Freedom and security principles for Germany''. http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_13533-544-2-30.pdf?110509134343</ref>
Immediately after Fukushima, the German Federal Parliament passed an amendment to the Atomic Energy Act, which mandated the shut down of eight nuclear reactors by August 2011 and the remaining nine by 2022.<ref>BfS (2013). The Federal Office for Radiation Protection. ''Act on the peaceful utilisation of atomic energy and the protection against its hazards (Atomic Energy Act)''. http://www.bfs.de/de/bfs/recht/rsh/volltext/A1_Englisch/A1_08_13_AtG_0514.pdf  </ref> This is a big step, as Germany is currently the fifth-largest generator of nuclear energy globally.<ref name="U.S. Energy" />

=== Pro-Renewables Groups ===
Pro-renewables groups include the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_party Green Party] and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Solar_Industry_Association German Solar Industry Association]. The Green Party links renewables to anti-nuclear movements: "The Fukushima nuclear disaster is a critical moment in the history of energy policy. Warning about the dangers of nuclear power was a driving force in the founding of the green movements worldwide."<ref>Alliance 90/The Greens Party (n.d.). ''Energy''. http://www.gruene-bundestag.de/service-navigation/english_ID_2000025.html.</ref>   The Greens consider the 2011 amendment to the Atomic Energy Act a victory.  The Green Party’s co-chairman, Cem Özdemir stated:  “It’s certainly the biggest success in the party history that even in the opposition we managed to force the other parties, in particular the governing parties, to follow us.”<ref name = "Bhatti">[Bhatti, J. (2013, May 28). The cost of green: Germany tussles over the bill for its energy revolution. ''Time''. http://world.time.com/2013/05/28/]</ref> 

The German Solar Industry Association represents the interests of 800 companies.<ref>BSW-Solar (2014). German solar energy industry. http://www.solarwirtschaft.de/en/about-us.html</ref>  According to the group’s communication director, David Wedepohl: “In the future, Germany’s electricity demand will be covered mostly with solar and wind power.  That’s because people want the Energiewende, and they are increasingly taking things into their own hands."<ref name = "Bhatti" />

=== Pro-Conventional Energy Groups ===
Groups such as the Association of Industrial Energy and Power Industry Association ( [http://vik.de/home.html VIK])  and the Federation of German Industries ([http://www.bdi.eu/BDI_english/index.htm BDI]) are concerned about the rising price of electricity from nuclear shutdowns.  VIK is a German association of industrial energy consumers and self-generators.<ref>VIK (2005). German Association of Industrial Energy Users and Self-Generators. ''VIK-Input for the European Commission 2005 report on the functioning of the electricity directive''. http://ec.europa.eu/energy/electricity/report_2005/doc/large_user_groups/28_vik_germany.pdf</ref> According to the head of VIK, Annette Loske: “Everything’s on the line here for us. This electricity price increase specific to Germany can’t be allowed to reach industry.”<ref>Comfort, N. (2013, May 31). Merkel’s atomic overhaul may aid industry at consumers’ expense.

Therefore, BDI asks for conventional energy companies to be compensated.<ref>BDI (2014). Federation of German industries. http://www.bdi.eu/bdi_english/index.htm.  </ref>

=== The Big Four ===
Four power companies have historically dominated the energy industry: [https://www.rwe.com/web/cms/en/8/rwe/ RWE], [http://www.eon.com/en.html E.ON], [https://www.enbw.com/index_en.html EnBW], and [http://corporate.vattenfall.com/ Vattenfall].<ref>Varadi, P.F. (2014, March 11). ''The future of large German utilities: It's already here.'' http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/</ref>  All four companies have nuclear plants that have been forced to shut down because of the 2011 amendment to the Atomic Energy Act.  RWE, Vattenfall, and E.ON have formal filed complaints against the government for uncompensated shutdown.<ref>The arbitration game: Governments are souring on treaties to protect foreign investors.

''The Economist.'' http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623756-governments-are-souring-treaties-protect-foreign-investors-arbitration  </ref>  EnBW’s chairman is also dissatisfied with the government’s policy, citing “extraordinary expenses” from the “immediate shutdown of two nuclear plants.”<ref>DW (2012). Deutsche Welle. ''EnBW 2011 earnings hit by German nuclear phaseout.'' http://www.dw.de/enbw-2011-earnings-hit-by-german-nuclear-phaseout/a-15792645</ref>

=== Solar Companies === 
Companies such as [http://www.juwi.com/homepage.html Juwi] and [http://www.solarworld.de/en/home/ SolarWorld] are focused entirely on renewable energy production.  Juwi designs and builds solar and wind plants around the world, encouraging 100% renewable energy supply.<ref>Juwi (2014). http://www.juwi.com/homepage.html</ref>  SolarWorld, one of the largest solar companies in the world, believes that photovoltaics are the “cornerstone of sustainable and fair economic development.”<ref>SolarWorld (2014). http://www.solarworld.de/en/home/    </ref>  While these two companies have been successful, another major company, [http://www.bosch.com/en/com/home/index.php Bosch], decided to shut down its solar energy division because of market price pressures and the loss of one billion euros in 2012.<ref>Pentland, W. (2013, March 25). Bosch shuts down solar business, suffers steep losses.

== The Renewable Energy Act ==

In 1991, Germany passed the Electricity Feed-In Act, which required utilities to purchase electricity generated from renewable resources at a higher price than that of conventional resources. The act did not differentiate between the various renewable energy resources despite differences in production costs.<ref>Germany, S. (1990). Germany’s Act on Feeding Renewable Energies into the Grid of 7 December 1990. Federal Law Gazette I, 2663.</ref>  As an improvement, the German Renewable Energy Act was passed in 2000 to achieve long-term cost reductions of renewable energy technologies, encouraging more companies to compete in the energy market. The act aims to produce 45% of Germany’s electricity demand by 2025, 60% by 2035, and 80% by 2050 from renewable resources.<ref>Brüns, E. (2010). Renewable Energies in Germany’s Electricity Market: A Biography of the Innovation Process. Springer.</ref>

The act includes three main principles. The first is offering investment protection and incentives by guaranteeing long-term contracts with cost-based prices. Renewable energy companies receive 20-year-long, technology-specific guaranteed payment for their electricity generation. Unlike the Electricity Feed-In Act, prices under this act are determined by the generation cost, allowing companies to enter the market in all renewable energy segments.<ref name="Jacobsson">[Jacobsson, S., & Lauber, V. (2006). The politics and policy of energy system transformation—explaining the German diffusion of renewable energy technology. Energy policy, 34(3), 256-276.]</ref>

Prior to this act, conventional energy companies did not bear the social and ecological consequences of their operations. The second principle in the act puts an additional cost on these companies determined by their total energy production. Because renewable energy companies do not have to pay these fees, they are now more price-competitive with conventional energy companies. <ref name="Jacobsson"/> Finally, the act reduces the feed-in tariffs over time, putting additional cost pressure on energy generators every year and forcing them to produce more efficient and cost-effective technologies.<ref name="Jacobsson"/> 

Despite its remarkable progress, Germany is facing some challenges such as integrating decentralized energy production technologies into existing electricity grids that were designed for centralized production. As the electricity generated by renewable resources increases, the need for updated grids becomes urgent.<ref>Hammons, T. J. (2008). Integrating renewable energy sources into European grids. International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, 30(8), 462-475.</ref> Additionally, the act was criticized by BDI and other associations, claiming that the act damaged the energy market competitiveness and drove up the energy prices. In 2014, the act was amended to slow the rise in the act’s surcharge to make it more manageable and ensure the smooth transition to and integration of these technologies. <ref>Verclas, K.

== Conclusions ==

The German solar movement is an example of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratization_of_technology%20 democratization of technology]. Since the 1980s, power has shifted from the four major energy companies to individuals and communities. More people now have access to solar systems due to the feed-in-tariff policy. 
This case also provides a counter-example to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_momentum%20 technological momentum theory].  As the German solar movement gained momentum socially, it shaped government policy.  In turn, government policy made conventional energy companies, in spite of their great momentum, implement renewable technologies.
