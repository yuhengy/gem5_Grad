=== Description ===

# On '''pause''' prepare to repeat the step to the left.

Repeat counts 1,2,3 and the pause, alternating sides.  Repeat on the next beat, beginning with the left foot.

Some authors distinguish different versions of tynok, based on the height of sweeping motions.  A low sweeping motion, where the feet are kept close to the ground, is called "small" or "maliy."  A medium sized sweeping motion, where the feet are brought about mid-calf height is called an intermediate tynok or "tynok seredniy."  A large tynok, where the feet are brought to about knee height, is performed only by men and boys and referred to as "tynok velykiy."

When performed as a travelling step, most of the forward movement occurs during the initial sweep before the count of '''one'''.  The motion is to leap forward onto right foot, cross the left foot over, and step again onto the right foot; then, leap forward with the left foot, cross the right foot over, step onto the left foot.

=== Arm Movement ===
Tynok may be performed with hands on hips, or by opening the arms to second position on the odd-numbered counts, and then closing them to the waist on the even-numbered counts.
