== Wiki Exercise #2: To what extent are my online and offline identities aligned? ==

[[File:Social Media Strategy.jpg|thumb|right|Trying to figure out social media.]]

Social media has provided people the opportunity to be whoever they want to be and is a platform for everyone to use to create their online identity. There are perks of having an online identity, from letting your friends know all at once that you are now engaged to the love of your life or how you have newly discovered that your favourite vegetable is avocado; then later conforming to the generic google search ‘is avocado a fruit or a vegetable?’. As futile as this google search may sound, you can now confirm information before posting anything to your social media pages, indicating to your online friends that you are one intelligent human being. #congrats. 

According to the internet, I step outside the statistic of 64% of adults using social media for at least 2 hours a day. [https://www.businessinsider.com/99-of-young-british-people-use-social-media-every-week-2016-8?r=US&IR=T Elder (2016)] Social media has its downsides, and therefore I cannot contribute to the online identities that the 64% can. As social media gives people the ability to be whoever they want to be, it also allows them to display the highlights of their lives. Bailey Parnell discusses more how social media obtains our highlight reel of interesting, fun things about us. What is interesting from her studies is that it is majorly based on 18-24-year olds, which I am included in. She discovers that students studying at university suffer with anxiety, depression and stress are also linked to those who are frequently active on their social media pages. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czg_9C7gw0o Is Social Media Hurting Your Mental Health?] In reality (the world that we breathe in), sometimes it isn’t healthy to watch your ‘friends’ online succeed when you are simply not where you want to be in life.

I may have a biased outlook on people and how they portray themselves online, but I know the social media hole that one can deeply dive into and get lost in. Not only can you be a version of yourself online, you can be whoever you want to be. McCreary expressed his belief that "in the modern era with Twitter and Facebook and social media, I think it's important to kind of get a version of yourself out there, because if you don't, someone else will." [http://muse.jhu.edu.ezproxy.stir.ac.uk/article/668671 McCreary (2017)] He talks about the importance of having social media, which I must disagree with; but understand that if you do not claim your social identity, someone else will. “The out-of-school reality of digital age students now heavily relies on the use of personal mobile devices such as laptops, tablets and smartphones.” [https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.stir.ac.uk/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-27893-3_1 Hughes, Morrison & Thompson (2016)] There is a sense of loneliness when you are the only person in your friend group who isn’t on their phone scrolling through the pointless pictures their high school friend posted of an avocado. 

Overall, after researching more into social media and how people represent themselves online, I am more certain that I do not want to pursue in the trend of scrolling and highlight reels. Deep down, I know this saddens me, but at the age of 22, I am hoping when my friends turn my present age, they will understand my struggles with social media and not conform to the daily food post updates. I would say that my online identity doesn’t exist right now, therefore, my offline identity is all I have to offer.

Hi {{reply to|Kay.Abbiey}}! This is a really interesting take on social media identity we don't see so often - switching off isn't something that I know many people to do. So, your lack of current online identity provides a perspective where you can look at the effects of impression management with a critical eye. I really like how varied the sources you've used are. TedX talks are always fun to watch, and seeing one so relevant threaded into your exercise was certainly nice! The only thing I'd think would improve in this is to supplement a source more current in terms of the '64% of adults' statistic as the article you originally cited is from three years ago. Otherwise, nice work! Looking forward to read more of your writing in the next exercise.

Hello {{reply to|Kay.Abbiey}}. I think you have a very unique perspective of social media that is uncommon nowadays in young people. It’s very intriguing to read your experiences online in respect to mental health and how you rank the importance of social media. What is also impressive is how you have managed to engage with different text that are both for and against your view of social media and shows your level of understanding of the topic of offline and online alignment. The contrasting arguments also helped developed your view a lot more and furthered your critical engagement with the texts. Like has already been mentioned, when using statistics, it is best to use more current numbers as it validates your points more. Overall, your mini-essay had a very clear critical argument and a unique perspective that was interesting to read.

Dear {{reply to|Kay.Abbiey}} First of all I hope I get to work with you at some point throughout our time at University and that the work we engage in will be productive and rewarding. I can relate to your views here for Online Social Media and the habits that the 18-24year old generation falls into. Though it may come across as critical objectivity, again I must say I can totally relate. I am very pleased to see that you state that your real-life and offline identity is all you have! There is nothing wrong with that at all. I hope you will be one of the conscious and awake individuals who insist on being present while treasuring real time experiences and preserving those in memory rather than through the screen / behind the screen filming and photographing posting ans snap chatting away rather than living for the moment. I hope you enjoy nature and the outdoors because the universe would love for you to spend your time with it in real time. Likewise if you enjoy the company of others may you always find rewarding fulfilling experiences; for there is more to gain than to be lost in the virtual world of made up identities. Thank you for your contribution well done!

Hey, {{reply to|Kay.Abbiey}} I really enjoyed reading your perspective on social media. I've heard of people taking short breaks from social media before but hearing a first-hand impression really drives it home how important it can be sometimes to disconnect yourself. Also, the use of presenting contrasting arguments from your own perspective really helps the overall message of your mini-essay.

== Wiki Exercise #4: Collaborative Essay Critical Evaluation - What ARE Wikis? ==

When searching for a definite definition of what Wikibooks is, I turned to the Wikibooks homepage itself. They describe their page as ‘the open-content textbooks collection that anyone can edit.’ [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page ("Wikibooks", 2019)] Wikipedia has twelve sisters, one of which is Wikibooks and others that work alongside Wikipedia. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikimedia_sister_projects ("Wikimedia sister projects", 2019)] Wikibooks, from my understanding, is used by anyone and everyone that wants to use it to write information online about different topics. 

After using Wikibooks for a project, I was lucky enough to work alongside a fantastic group of students who helped keep up my motivation. Solely, I do think that they are the only reason that I participated within the project as I would’ve hated to be the pretentious student with a hate towards social media, who lets their team down. After reading a journal from the year 2014, I understand that Wikibooks has probably advanced five years on however, it discusses important points that one might not think about when enjoying the advanced technology that we have discovered. It asks the question if Wikibooks is the new textbook. It explains how the traditional way of education is usually between a teacher and a student, however now there is a piece of technology dividing the relationship between this. [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/21532974.2011.10784665?casa_token=L6Q8bunYwDQAAAAA:xouDGR68aMq1C4IrK_-V8KvYRvIntIZQnp0h1CJHhrStu_U3Up2A_Q7gPTGTnnCCTBdAxyw5dokG_MI (O’Shea, Allen, Onderdonk & Allen, 2014)]

When I was participating in the Wikibooks project with my team members, I realised that I struggled a lot to keep up with updating my side of the page. At that time, I had deleted every social media platform due to it making my mental health suffer. Although I do believe that Wikibooks is not seen as a social media platform, and I doubt ever will be seen as one, the discussion page gave everyone a chance to share their thoughts and opinions on everyone’s topic; thus, allowing opinions and words spreading viral online. This reminded me of the anxiety that overtook my mind when I sat scrolling on Facebook, hoping that someone would like a pointless status that I had written ten days ago. 

[[File:Class rural teacher.jpg|thumb|Teacher]]

Although I have had my fair share of negative thoughts towards Wikibooks, I do believe that it is a good website for students to use to keep in contact when working on a project together. A journal talks about the advantages of having the internet in schools and having platforms that allow students and teachers to connect. The two advantages that struck me were, changing teacher beliefs about teaching and learning and sufficient and accessible equipment. [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15391523.2005.10782449?casa_token=Ooe0hxBi8eoAAAAA:cfxaatPeuoAYX_SHrZk5_8ttRxrOtxJK7vvrb-0aiA-EjkbgccOLyG6AzSY88Trjzq5tpcU_pnrhqVk (Hernández-Ramos, 2005)] I do recognise that there are positives to platforms like Wikiboooks, especially when it comes to education as it is a lot easier for interaction between students and teachers. 

Overall, I don’t think I got a good taste of Wikibooks and I am quite thankful that this is my last piece that I will be writing on Wikibooks. As I noticed on another Wikibooks entries, they asked the question to other students as to whether or not they think they will use Wikibooks in the future? This is the question I would like to end this on. [[User:Kay.Abbiey|Kay.Abbiey]] ([[User talk:Kay.Abbiey|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kay.Abbiey|contribs]]) 20:35, 3 April 2019 (UTC)

===INSTRUCTOR FEEDBACK: ENGAGEMENT ON DISCUSSION PAGES & CONTRIBS===

Grade descriptors for Engagement: 
Engagement on discussion pages, and contribs of this standard attain the following grade descriptor. Whereas not all of the elements here will be directly relevant to your particular response to the brief, this descriptor will give you a clearer idea of how the grade you have been given relates to the standards and quality expected of work at this level:
:::'''Satisfactory.''' Among other things, satisfactory contributions may try to relate an idea from the module to an original example, but might not be very convincing. They may waste space on synopsis or description, rather than making a point. They may have spelling or grammatical errors and typos. They might not demonstrate more than a single quick pass at the assignment, informed only by lecture and/or cursory reading. They may suggest reading but not thinking (or indeed the reverse) and will have little justification for ideas offered on Discussion Pages. The wiki markup formatting will need some work.
As instructed in the labs, and outlined in the assessment brief documentation, students should be engaging at least once a day, for the duration of the project. The following points illustrate how this engagement is evaluated.

Evidence from '''contribs''' to both editing and discussion of content (i.e. volume and breadth of editorial activity as evidenced through ‘contribs’). These are primarily considered for quality rather than quantity, but as a broad guideline:
::Each item on a contribs list that are 3000+ characters are deemed “considerable”
::Each item on a contribs list that are 2000+ characters are deemed “significant”
::Each item on a contribs list that are 1000+ characters are deemed “substantial”
::Items on a contribs list that are <1000 characters are important, and are considered in the round when evaluating contribs as a whole because of their aggregate value

'''Overall:'''
:::Fairly inconsistent record of engagement during the project period. What is there is of good quality, so I think that had you engaged throughout you would have made a considerable difference. That said, there is one contrib that could be deemed '''substantial''' as well as some useful contribs and exchanges towards the end.

Engagement with and learning from the community on '''Discussion Pages'''
::Evidence of peer-assisted learning and collaboration
:::'''Poor'''
::Evidence of reading, sharing, and application of research to the essay
:::'''Satisfactory'''
::Evidence of peer-review of others’ work
:::'''Satisfactory'''

Reflexive, creative and well-managed use of Discussion Pages
::Clear delegation of tasks
:::'''Poor'''
::Clearly labelled sections and subsections
:::'''Satisfactory'''
::Contributions are all signed
:::'''Satisfactory'''
:::'''Poor'''

Civility. Your conduct is a key component of any collaboration, especially in the context of an online knowledge-building community. Please respect others, as well as observe the rules for civility on wiki projects. All contribs are moderated.
:::'''Satisfactory'''

===Instructor Feedback on Wiki Exercise Portfolio===
{{reply to|Kay.Abbiey}}

Posts and comments on other people’s work, of this standard, roughly correspond to the following grade descriptor. Depending on where your actual mark is in relation to the making criteria as outlined in the relevant documentation, it should give you an idea of strengths and weaknesses within the achieved grade band overall:

:::Poor. Among other things, poor entries may just offer links without real comment or apparent point. They may offer nothing more than poor-quality synopsis or description of material of dubious relevance. They may have serious clarity problems (including dead links, random graphics) which affect comprehension (or even worse, admin warnings or take-down notices for copyright infringement). They might be off-topic, private trivia, or of unclear relevance. The wiki markup formatting will be of a poor standard.

:::This grade isn’t reflective of the quality of work you produced (as a matter of fact, the quality of content in your portfolio is excellent – it’s a real shame that you have submitted incomplete). There’s clearly room for improvement here, particularly in relation to attending to the details in the assessment briefs.. I think in order to engage with the wiki exercises a bit more, it might be useful for you to look at the Grade Descriptors and criteria in the module handbook to get more of an idea of how to hit those targets.

:::What you have submitted makes excellent use of the wiki functionality and markup would have gone some way to improving fluidity and functionality of posts. I suspect that, if you become more familiar and proficient with the platform, that this would make a difference.

:::Re: responses to other people’s posts – these are fairly good, if a little sporadic and not quite a complete set. Remember that the comments are "worth" as much as posts themselves. The reason for this is not only to help encourage discussion (a key element of wiki collaboration!) but also to get you to reflect upon your own work. This can all, of course be used to fuel ideas that might form part of your project work. 

General:
:::Reading and research: evidence of critical engagement with set materials; evidence of independent reading of appropriate academic and peer-reviewed material – all good quality.

:::Argument and analysis: well-articulated and well-supported argument; evidence of critical thinking (through taking a position in relation to key ideas from the module, and supporting this position); evidence of relational thinking (through making connections between key ideas from the module and wider literature, and supporting these connections); evidence of independent critical ability – all v. good quality.

:::Presentation: good use of wiki markup and organisational skills.
