The purpose of this page is to give you a brief outline of the key events and happenings covered throughout this book.  Events that are specifically outlined in the text are linked to the proper place to allow you to quickly research them.  Broader events and occurrences are not linked to specific sections since they are general conclusions that should be reached by having a background in European history that would come from reading the text.
