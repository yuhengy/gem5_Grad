== Project scope ==

I understand that you are trying to help Wikibooks in a positive way. Unfortunately, your contributions do not comply with our policies and guidelines, particularly [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]]. Please note that Wikibooks does not accept the following:
*Promotions about your noble cause, as this constitutes bias;
*Works that are in the public domain; those belong to our sister project, [[s:Main Page|Wikisource]];
*Works that are heavily biased on one side; for example, even saying that Hitler was evil is not allowed here, even though most people think he is.
