{{definition|site|A '''site''' is a category <math>C</math> together with a Grothendieck topology on it.}}

Many of the statements below hold true for general functor categories.

 this definition does not yet capture all points; improvement is under way.

{{remark|points exist in small sites|If the underlying category of <math>S</math> is small, then it is easily seen that the inverse systems on <math>S</math> form a set, so that Zorn's lemma implies the existence of points.}}

:<math>\mathbf{Sh}(S, C) \to C</math>
which on objects is given by
:<math>\mathcal F \mapsto \mathcal F_x</math>.}}

{{proof|If <math>f: \mathcal F \to \mathcal G</math> is a morphism of presheaves, then the cocone implied in the definition of <math>\mathcal G_x</math> may be precomposed with <math>f</math>, which yields a cocone over the same diagram that is used in the definition of <math>\mathcal F_x</math>. Thus, the universal property of <math>\mathcal F_x</math> yields a morphism <math>f_x: \mathcal F_x \to \mathcal G_x</math>, and we use this assignment as the definition of the desired functor on morphisms. The uniqueness of this assignment ensures that <math>(g \circ f)_x = g_x \circ f_x</math> whenever <math>g: \mathcal G \to \mathcal H</math> and <math>f: \mathcal F \to \mathcal G</math> are morphisms of presheaves.

{{proof|This follows since <math>\text{PreSh}(S,C)</math> is nothing but a functor category, and [[for functor categories that statement is true]].}}

{{proposition|image and kernel of presheaf morphisms commute with the stalk functor|Let <math>\mathcal F, \mathcal G</math> be two presheaves on a site <math>S</math> with values in a category <math>C</math>. If <math>f: \mathcal F \to \mathcal G</math> is a morphism of presheaves, then
:<math>(\ker f)_x = \ker f_x</math> and <math>(\operatorname{im} f)_x = \operatorname{im} f_x</math>.}}

{{proof|Since the stalk functor maps the zero map to the zero map (as is readily seen from the universal property defining this functor), <math>(\ker f)_x</math> factors over <math>\ker f_x</math>.}}

{{definition|pushforward presheaf|Let <math>F: T \to S</math> be a continuous functor from the site <math>S</math> to the site <math>T</math>, and let <math>\mathcal F: S \to C</math> be a presheaf on <math>S</math>.

:<math>F^*\mathcal G(U) := \varprojlim_{U \to F(V)} \mathcal G(V)</math>,
where the morphisms are given by the universal property of the inverse limit, which is supposed to range over all maps from <math>U</math> to any object in the image of <math>F</math>.}}

{{proposition|pullback and pushforward of presheaves are adjoint functors|Let <math>F: T \to S</math> be a functor (which may, for instance, be a continuous functor from <math>S</math> to <math>T</math>). Then there exists an isomorphism

that is natural in <math>\mathcal F</math> and <math>\mathcal G</math>; that is, <math>F_*</math> and <math>F^*</math> are adjoint functors.}}

{{proof|On an object <math>U \in S</math>, a morphism <math>\mathcal F \to F^*\mathcal G</math> will yield a morphism
:<math>\mathcal F(U) \to \varprojlim_{F(W) \to U} \mathcal G(W)</math>.
Let now <math>V \in T</math> and suppose that <math>U = F(V)</math>. Then from the above, we obtain a morphism
:<math>F_*\mathcal F(V) \to \mathcal G(V)</math>,
since then the direct limit on the right hand side of the first morphism is simply <math>\mathcal G(V)</math>, as this will be a maximal element. From the functoriality of <math>F</math> and the fact that the morphism <math>\mathcal F \to F^*\mathcal G</math> was a morphism of presheaves, one easily sees that one may use that the restriction maps of the pullback are simply the ones of <math>\mathcal G</math> on the image of <math>F</math> in order to prove that a morphism of presheaves is thus defined.

Conversely, on an object <math>V \in T</math>, a morphism <math>F_*\mathcal F \to \mathcal G</math> will yield a morphism
:<math>\mathcal F(F(V)) \to \mathcal G(V)</math>.
If now <math>U \in S</math> is given, we obtain from this a morphism
:<math>\mathcal F(U) \to \mathcal F(F(V)) \to \mathcal G(V)</math>
for every morphism <math>U \to F(V)</math> in <math>S</math>. The universal property of the inverse limit turns this into a morphism
:<math>\mathcal F(U) \to F^*\mathcal G(U)</math>.
This is a morphism of presheaves, as is seen from applying the universal property of <math>F^*\mathcal G(U')</math> to the cone with tip <math>\mathcal F(U)</math> for a morphism <math>U \to U'</math> in <math>S</math>.

Since by uniqueness a morphism
:<math>\mathcal F(U) \to \varprojlim_{F(W) \to U} \mathcal G(W)</math>
may just as well arise from the universal property of the latter inverse limit and morphisms
:<math>\mathcal F(F(W)) \to \mathcal G(W)</math> (there is a morphism in <math>S</math> from <math>F(W)</math> to <math>U</math>)
and for <math>U = F(V)</math>, the map from presheaf morphisms on <math>T</math> to presheaf morphisms on <math>S</math> does not change the morphism at all, the two maps are inverses of each other. Thus, we have shown
:<math>\operatorname{Hom}_{\text{PreSh}(S,C)}(\mathcal F, F^*\mathcal G) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_{\text{PreSh}(T,C)}(F_*\mathcal F, \mathcal G)</math>.

Naturality in <math>\mathcal F</math> follows from the commutativity of the triangl
:triangle.svg (F'(F(V)) to F(F(V)) to G(V))
and naturality in <math>\mathcal G</math>}}
