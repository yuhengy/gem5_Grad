Tell me about it. We are now going to be pros at this! WIKI Symposium Go-ers; we're gonna own this! ;-) [[User:Camilla baier|Camilla baier]] ([[User talk:Camilla baier|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Camilla baier|contribs]]) 18:24, 19 March 2014 (UTC)


Hi Lea. I noticed you said you had had discussions with your group- was that over wikibooks discussion, and if so would you be able to tell me how to do it? I think it would be a bit easier than the way we are doing it at the moment. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:34, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

RE: ButtonsElizabeth, your best bet is to either get them to post on the discussion page and mention your other team member’s names in it or potentially you could get them all to just leave notes on each other’s discussion pages. It is of course much easier to meet up with your members together if you are all uncertain of what needs to be done, or potentially you could make a Facebook group with all your members and allocate topics that way or even just share ideas, however, though these are considered to be more convenient, they will gain you no marks for input on the wiki book as Greg will not be able to take note of all of your ideas and the ways in which you have helped each other unless it is via either Wikipedia or the WikiBook.

BerinLea, in what I am considering talking about on the wikibook, I feel has direct link to some of your ideas that you also wish to talk about for instance, how one may use online mediums to define and redefine themselves and gather together their sense of self, this I feel would come under the development of identities which is something you seem keen to cover.

RE: SmithBiancaAnn
Thanks for the input. I have specified my topic a bit more and will mostly write about personalised adverts- so how companies target users by gathering their personal information from social media. Feel free to update me about your stuff so we can think about how to link it.

Hey, youre doing the personalised advertisement aren't you? i found this article about consumerism as a form of self expression and it mentions how the the internet and SMS are used to further this, i dunno how relevant it is to what you're doing but it might be interesting to give it a read? [[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 15:49, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

mmh... geht so. But I will have my entry up by tonight. ([[User:Camilla baier|Camilla baier]] ([[User talk:Camilla baier|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Camilla baier|contribs]]) 11:06, 3 April 2014 (UTC))

Ich machs heute abend wenn ich wieder den rechner ausleihen kann. 
Danke für die Motivation!

I will read through your post later today Lea, although you might only get to see it tomorrow, given the time difference...  ([[User:Camilla baier|Camilla baier]] ([[User talk:Camilla baier|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Camilla baier|contribs]]) 13:33, 3 April 2014 (UTC))

Hey did a quick read through, really good, strongly written and arguments are well supported, really good work! the only thing i could say would be maybe expand on the point you made about "advertisement becoming a status symbol" i know its a minor point but its pretty interesting, but what do i know :) [[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 14:28, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

== Draft- to be proof-read ==

'''Social Networks and Advertising'''

The terms '''Social network advertising''' or '''Social media targeting''' refer to forms of online advertisement that specifically focus on their presence on social networking sites. Social network advertising involves adverts being tailored to user information gathered from social media profiles. Given the enormous audience size and amount of time regularly spent on social networking sites companies increasingly become aware of the vast potential lying in SNS. Consequently online advertising is experiencing a shift from simply being distributed through websites to efficiently tracking and gathering user behaviour and personal information on SNS. This enables brands to identify and address their target audience and people that their product might appeal to based on their interests. The fact that these information originate from the customers themselves is majorly beneficial to companies as personal data can be analysed in detail without having to rely on their own statistical projections. Two strategies used in social network advertising are '''targeted advertising''' and '''customised advertising'''.

In '''targeted advertising''' brands aim to shape their product display according to website relevant content or their target group’s interests. While content-targeted advertising is adapted to the particular purpose and content of a website the advert banner is displayed on, targeted advertising tracks the users’ surfing behaviour on the internet. Several websites require users to register with their facebook accounts in order to later display similar advertising content on the social network site. Through the use of cookies people can be tracked back to recently visited websites and are therefore likely to be exposed to similar content on other websites. Companies are also able to track whether one of their adverts has been encountered by a particular customer before and are consequently able to avoid unwanted repetition in exposures and display their contents within appropriate intervals (Braun, 2011, Measuring Online Advertising Effectiveness). A look-a-like function enables the detection of facebook users with similar interests as the one recently accessing a particular website. 

Moving away from simply tracking people’s surfing behaviour via cookies, online advertisement has experienced an important shift to putting more emphasis on using profile information on SNS to create '''customised advertisements''' (Spyer, http://www.theguardian.com/salesforce-partner-zone/taking-advantage-of-targeted-advertisements-on-social-media). Social network accounts provide brands with valuable information about users’ location, interests and social circles. Likes and links to external websites further enrich the image of potential customers that might be targeted in future. According to their profile details users receive pre-selected adverts that are believed to be most compatible with their demands and interests and therefore should be more appealing to them. 

However the massive amount of data genrated by “real identities“ via social networks (http://venturebeat.com/2011/03/15/reid-hoffman-data-sxsw/) is also centre of the growing debate on the implications of the web 3.0 (Reid Hoffman, http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2012/02/the-dark-side-to-personalised-internet.html). As Joseph Turow suggests “the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your world“ (Turow, J. (2012). The daily you: How the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your worth. Yale University Press.) through displaying user customised advertisements on social networks. In this way commodification, capitalist social relations and market forces increasingly engage in and detemine people’s social life by exploiting the fact that to a large extent social interactions are taking place online (Cohen, 2008, The Valorization of Surveillance: Towards a Political Economy of Facebook. Democratic Communique [online]. 22(1), [Accessed 3 March 2013], pp. 5-22. Available From: http://udc.igc.org/communique/issues/Spring2008/cohen.pdf). Consequently social networks have to be considered a double-edged sword (van Dijk, 2013, The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media. New York: Oxford University Press.). While on the one hand being intensely empowering for its users, the fact that their data is under constant surveillance by data mining and analytics companies such as Daily Me, Medicx Media and Rapleaf can also lead to consumers restisting (White et al., 2008) the advert’s appeal as they feel their privacy is being violated (Stone, 2010, http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/technology/04facebook.html?_r=0). Thereby, the root of the problem is the fact that boundaries between advertising and content shaping the 20th-century media are being blurred through networking sites (Turow). However, the significance of personalised advertising does not only make user data a valuable criteria to shape brands after but goes even further. Through “social sorting“ social networks even impact structures of society in allocating people to “target“ or “waste“ (Turow) groups based on information published on their profiles. Brands can explicitely filter out the users that are most valuable to them in terms of a responsiveness to their product based on their interests, income or other characteristics.  In this way the advertisement that is presented to each individual user is indicating their social position in the eyes of companies, making advertisement become status signals (Turow). Nevertheless, companies have to consider the discrepancy between online and offline identity as so far social sorting processes are simply based on personal information generated on SNS. Therefore customer profiles only limitedly reflect the “real“ person behind the profile, including their demands of a product. While social media’s functionality provide the tools for people to construct an online identity they are also heavily shaped after the economic purpose of the site. Cohen (2008, The Valorization of Surveillance: Towards a Political Economy of Facebook. Democratic Communique [online]. 22(1), [Accessed 3 March 2013], pp. 5-22. Available From: http://udc.igc.org/communique/issues/Spring2008/cohen.pdf) suggests that due to their design and the normalisation of the sharing culture SNS can be considered part of an increasing commodification of identity through the influence of corporate interests.

That sounds really good Lea! Really impressive academic writing! Something that relates to that subject is that different companies are collaborating with different bloggers. Like a fashion blog collaborates with an online shop with the shop giving them stuff to review. This way they get advertising space, too. Though that doesn't really relate to personalized ads, so maybe it's not relevant to your subject. Anyways, your piece looks really good and there's nothing I'd do differently!

Perfect! Solid material, excellent referencing, and I like how you've made key phrases bold, it's a nice touch. Sounds very professional and wiki-ish (oh the irony of that sentence). Great topic idea too! [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 19:02, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Exactly. Not really much to proof read here. I went onto the Online Identity page and wanted to correct a typo I saw, but it had already been taken care of. Great work Lea!
