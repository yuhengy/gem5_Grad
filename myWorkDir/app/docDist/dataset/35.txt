With the progress of the Internet and technology, the Internet connects our lives. It makes it easier for people to communicate and learn about the world through the Internet and the screen without leaving home. My screen use in life is usually the computer and the mobile phone. And according to my personal mobile phone display record : this week I used a total of screen time for 42h24m  which the software is of most use screen WeChat software (social media application) followed by video entertainment software and search engine, some other tools for example online shopping to buy train and movies ticket,they also takes up part of the screen time when using, I categorize screen time use in the following ways<br>



'''Screen time usage ratio and classification'''<br>

Total screen-time: 42 hours24 minutes
Categories:<br>

1: Social networking: 20h1m.48%
(wechat instagram Sina weibo, etc.)
2. leisure entertainment: 15h50m.38 %
(Video, movie, music, etc.)
3. other tools: 1 h32m. 14%
(Ticket buying tools, map.video clip, mailbox, Google, Electronic dictionary)
<br>

The above is just my personal screen usage information and classification. I divided the screen heavy software into three categories: social media, entertainment, and tools. Since each person's situation is different, it depends on individual interests and needs. For example, my friend “D” likes playing games, so the game software takes up the most screen time for her. Or people who like shopping online, obviously the shopping platform will take up the most screen time usage.Therefore, my personal opinion is that interests and hobbies or needs determine the screen usage rate.

Electronic devices represented by computers and mobile phones are changing our lives. Always-online has become a "default state" of many modern people. The changes brought by mobile Internet are "always-online" and service informatization, which means that users keep in touch with the network at any time. Mobile electronic devices are becoming an increasingly important topic in both study and work (Antonis, Daradoumis, Papadakis, & Simos, 2011). With the increasing popularity of personal digital assistants (pdas), smart phones, personal computers and other wireless communication devices, mobile learning methods are becoming a global reality, even for developing countries (Barker, Krull, & Mallinson, 2005). Simply put, as long as we are connected to the Internet, we can search for the information we need and know the movements of others in a few seconds, and it is a very flexible communication tool. We can do all kinds of collaborative work at lightning speed and exchange ideas with each other.However, users still have the right to choose whether or not others can contact me, even if we are online and not be disturbed.

===Instructor Feedback on Wiki Exercise 1===

:::Posts of this standard roughly correspond to the following grade descriptor. Depending on where your actual mark is in relation to the making criteria as outlined in the relevant documentation, it should give you an idea of strengths and weaknesses within the achieved grade band overall:

'''Pass '''. Among other things, pass entries may try to relate an idea from the module to an original example, but might not be very convincing. They may waste space on synopsis or description, rather than making a point. They may have spelling or grammatical errors and typos. They might not demonstrate more than a single quick pass at the assignment, informed only by lecture and/or cursory reading. They may suggest reading but not thinking (or indeed the reverse). The wiki markup formatting will need some work.

:::This work is at the upper end of this particular grade band, but even so, a little improvement will go a long way to attaining a higher mark. I think in order to engage with the wiki exercises a bit more, it might be useful for you to take a closer look at the assessment brief to get more of an idea of how to hit those targets. 

:::Making more use of the wiki functionality and markup would have gone a long way to improving fluidity and functionality of posts. I suspect that, as you become more familiar and proficient with the platform, that this will make a considerable difference.

Detail:
*Fairly well written in general, articulating a good sense of what the assessment brief is asking for.
*As stated, perhaps a little ore work on wiki mark-up and formatting going forward, just to make better use of the platform (through embedded links, images and so on).
*In addition, it is good to see that you are reading fairly independently, and have brought this material in to support your arguments. I would advise that as well as this independent work, that you engage with the suggested weekly readings on the Resource List as these had direct links to some of the points you were making.  

General:
::: 'Reading and research': evidence of critical engagement with set materials; evidence of independent reading of appropriate academic and peer-reviewed material. Merit.

::: 'Argument and analysis': well-articulated and well-supported argument; evidence of critical thinking (through taking a position in relation to key ideas from the module, and supporting this position); evidence of relational thinking (through making connections between key ideas from the module and wider literature, and supporting these connections); evidence of independent critical ability. Merit.
::: 'Presentation': good use of wiki markup and organisational skills. Pass.

'''

Liu, A., 2012: ‘Where is cultural criticism in the digital humanities?’, Debates in the digital humanities, 10: 490-509.


Liu (2012) discusses the cultural criticism in Digital Humanities. The aim of the study is to recommend the ways in which the antithetical can be converted into an opportunity through the deficits in digital Humanities identified by the author. The study draws upon previous literature, Casanova’s letters, maps, and descriptive arguments. The study argues that the development of Digital Humanities is hampered due to lacking culture criticism. The scope of the study is regarding various tools that can be instrumental in advancing in the field. The study is useful as it can help digital humanists develop a foundation for contributing to humanities. In conclusion, the author highlighted that humans can contribute to humanities by practising instrumentalism and highlighting the importance of Humanities alongside science. I can use the research and build upon the recommendations of the author for conducting future research for the advancement of Humanities.

'''Wiki Exercise 3: Social Movement Case Study'''

A social movement is a collective action in which people are persuaded to join the organization voluntarily; In this way, some activities of putting forward or resisting together with the organization are similar to resisting social structure and change. Most members who participate in social movements usually gather through informal network relationships, in which participants agree with and support the ideas and appeals of the movement, so as to initiate and participate in social movements.

In the era of network convenience, with the rapid development of new media technology, the large number of users and the powerful social penetration of social media, social media has gradually penetrated into social life. The update and influence of social media in technology is very powerful. People can organize and call for social activities through social media, and inquire the factors and specific contents of social movements. This has also enabled some active members to keep in touch with each other and enhanced the group strength and regional strength. (Hwang, H. and Kim, K. 2015）.The social power created through social media is huge.  The Egyptian revolutionary social movement is a good example of how social media is driving the Egyptian revolution.
[[File:Egyptian social movement.jpg|thumb|Egyptian social movement]]

Because Egypt's internal development has been unbalanced for years, the gap between the poor and the unemployment rate are increasing. Due to the gap between political expectation and reality, the unemployed with unbalanced proportion have a strong sense of deprivation.Three sources have played an important role in the Egyptian social movement: the anti-opposition coalition, the social support network that the opposition relies on to gain a support base, and the social media platforms of blogs, Facebook, Twit and others.Driven by social media, the four main groups that initially launched the Egyptian demonstrations had five accounts on twitter and relied on the Internet to form a network of relationships: first, software analysis revealed that the movement that initially launched the revolution had formed a network of relationships on social media.Second, some activists in the movement have exposed their network connections. The demonstration posted on the website on January 14th states that activists from all over Egypt have agreed to hold a peaceful uprising against torture, poverty, corruption and unemployment on January 25th. To defend the rights of all egyptians furthermore, the network of relationships on social media is not only within the borders of Egypt, but can also cross political boundaries and form a global network of relationships to interact online . The Egyptian government has begun shutting down 90 percent of mobile phone Internet traffic in the country, disrupting the way protesters log on to social networking sites on their smartphones to send out news and photos of the demonstrations. However, the protesters' voicemail messages were replaced by text messages posted on twitter with technical support, and continued to be linked to social networking sites.（Shehata, M.2017).

'''The influence of social media on social movements'''

The information of various social movements will be exposed in large quantities, and individual motivation will rise to group action. Social media can also be upgraded to international agenda discussion through a regional public opinion hotspot. Because of the global connection of social media, the public can find out the hot news happening around the world in the first time. The rise and development of social movements are inseparable from the intervention and shaping of social media. Social media has a lasting and far-reaching influence on social movements, which can not only promote a social movement, but also become a means to intensify social conflicts and subvert the state power.

'''Wiki Exercise 4: Collaborative Essay Critical Evaluation
'''

Wikis are global, multilingual encyclopedias, similar to online libraries, with the goal and purpose of providing free encyclopedias for all humanity, a dynamic, freely accessible and editable global knowledge base. Wikis are simple and open to use, allowing users to browse, create, and change freely, as well as providing a simple communication platform for users. Using wikis, writers can easily create a community that expands to attract more users to discuss and give feedback. A wiki community is defined as a website that provides a co-authoring environment, including text, images, and video. That is, everyone can modify the information on the page of the site, or expand and discuss common topics. It sounds crazy, but what if a stranger comes to the site and messes up the topic? Don't worry too much about this, all wikis have version control, you can always retrieve the correct version, because you're not alone in the community, and the power of the community is amazing.( Ferrier, A. 2017)Wiki is a search engine, just like Google, which is a network space formed by hundreds of millions of netizens, who participate in the creation, maintenance, editing and modification. One of the benefits of wikis is that they can act as a personal knowledge base, which is actually a large collaborative knowledge base for many people. Wikis are easy to maintain and create, easy to format, basic content can be edited in text, links are easy to use, and internal links are generated by entering a simple "entry name." References to external links are also convenient. At the same time, the wiki record page has the ability to revise the history, which allows the whole text to be continuously optimized, which is also an open function. Community members can create, modify, or delete any page. Visitors can clearly see the changes in the system page.(Twu, H. 2010).
[[File:BI8ShRLsXSUw-1sagrci9Q% 3D% 3D% 2F6597093955913937216.jpg|thumb|BI8ShRLsXSUw-1sagrci9Q% 3D% 3D% 2F6597093955913937216]]
However, in my opinion, wiki also has some defects, for example, because everyone can participate in the topic, discuss and edit it, the authority and accuracy of information and content cannot be guaranteed. Besides, some materials are too complicated and not concise enough. If the academic materials are too detailed and complicated, the general readers will think that reading is difficult and the articles are too long and lose interest. But wikis are constantly updated and free of charge, and because everyone has different opinions, they enrich the cultural diversity, make the content richer and closer to life, and make it easier to understand. Wiki is an independent, high credibility website, it not only has a wealth of information sources, eliminate one-sided statements, so that the reader in the information judgment has sufficient choice, and can objectively reproduce the truth of events and people. In addition, I think wiki is an open and permanent online resource, because it is a global search engine, which means anyone can use wiki online all day long. You can search at any time, make sure other users are online throughout the day, and get timely responses and answers to your questions. This means that wikis never go offline.

Students should be engaging at least once a day, for the duration of the project. The following points illustrate how this engagement was evaluated.

Evidence from ''contribs'' to both editing and discussion of content (i.e. volume and breadth of editorial activity as evidenced through ‘contribs’). These are primarily considered for quality rather than quantity, but as a broad guideline:
:::Each item on a contribs list that are 1000+ characters are deemed “substantial”: '''none'''
:::Items on a contribs list that are <1000 characters are important, and are considered in the round when evaluating contribs as a whole because of their aggregate value: '''certainly not for the duration of the project, and not near the level, standard, nor quantity advised in the wikilabs. around 10 contribs in total is not the expected standard here. all of these submitted over 3 days (15th, 16th and 29th Nov).'''
:::It is expected that you will make at least one contrib per day, for the duration of the project: '''the project assessment period lasted over three weeks'''

Posts of this standard roughly correspond to the following grade descriptor. Depending on where your actual mark is in relation to the making criteria as outlined in the relevant documentation, it should give you an idea of strengths and weaknesses within the achieved grade band overall:<br>
:::'''Satisfactory'''. Among other things, pass entries may try to relate an idea from the module to an original example, but might not be very convincing. They may waste space on synopsis or description, rather than making a point. They may have spelling or grammatical errors and typos. They might not demonstrate more than a single quick pass at the assignment, informed only by lecture and/or cursory reading. They may suggest reading but not thinking (or indeed the reverse). The wiki markup formatting will need some work.<br>

:::This work is at the upper end of this grade band, but even so, a little improvement would go a long way towards attaining a higher mark to push you into the next grade band. I think in order to engage with the wiki exercises a bit more, it might be useful for you to take a closer look at the assessment brief to get more of an idea of how to hit those targets, attending to details further.  Making more use of the wiki functionality and markup would have gone a long way to improving fluidity and functionality of posts. I suspect that, if you become more familiar and proficient with the platform, that this will make a considerable difference. Finally, although your writing seems to be improving with practice, a little more work in the area of effective written communication would help to improve things.<br>
'''General''':
In addition to the common marking scheme, there are three broad criteria widely employed in the Division, which are used to help assessors evaluate your work in a more general sense:<br>

''Reading and research'': is there evidence of critical engagement with set materials?; is there evidence of independent reading of appropriate academic and peer-reviewed material? 
For this element, your work has been evaluated as: '''Satisfactory'''<br>
''Argument and analysis'': Is argument well-articulated and well-supported?; is there evidence of critical thinking (through taking a position in relation to key ideas from the module, and supporting this position)?; is there evidence of relational thinking (through making connections between key ideas from the module and wider literature, and supporting these connections)?; is there evidence of independent critical ability? 
For this element, your work has been evaluated as: '''Merit'''<br>
''Presentation'': academic writing style and structure, and organisational skills 
For this element, your work has been evaluated as: '''Merit'''
