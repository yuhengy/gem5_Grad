{{TOC right}}

A system designer should know the current state of knowledge in topics relevant to their work. There are several reasons.  One is to not repeat work already done by someone else. Another is to stimulate new ideas and improvements. In addition to the references listed below and elsewhere in the book, it is very useful to know how to find additional information.  Categories of information include:

* Current News (Magazines, Newspapers, Blogs)
* Archival Publications (Journals, Preprint Archives)
* Books 
* Online Data (Web and other protocols)
* Technical Reports
* Product Data
* Discussion Forums

Once information is located you should record where and how you found it, to save having to find it again.  There are a number of ways to do that, depending on type of media: building a personal library in paper or electronic form, bookmarking in web browsers, etc.  As long as you have the ability to find the data again, the particular methods can be left to personal preference.


==Current News==

As of 2012, obtaining current news via paper-based sources is nearly obsolete.  Internet-based electronic delivery is faster and less expensive.  There are innumerable online websites, magazines, and blogs covering every topic relevant to space systems.  One distinction between sites is original reporting vs re-posting of news from elsewhere.  You should also consider the quality and experience of the writers and any bias they might have.  We cannot list all possible news sources, and any such list would rapidly become obsolete.  Therefore we will list a few good examples and encourage looking for good sources in your fields of interest.


'''General News'''

* '''[http://news.google.com/ Google News]''' - General news aggregator.  This means they do not write original stories, but rather link to stories from multiple other sources. Searchable and customizable, it is a good starting point to find other regular sources. Story selection for the front page is automated, but the full database indexes several thousand news sites.
* '''Reddit [http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/ Technology], [http://www.reddit.com/r/science/ Science], and [http://www.reddit.com/r/space/ Space] Topics''' - Reader submitted daily links divided by topic, with active discussions.  There are many topic headings, but the three listed are the largest related to space.  It is another news aggregator, but human-submitted and filtered by votes of the readers.


'''General Space'''

* '''[http://www.space.com/ Space.com]''' - General news website for anything related to space.


'''General Technology'''

* '''[http://nextbigfuture.com/ Next Big Future]''' - Blog for all kinds of new and future science and technology.  Often covers space topics.


'''General Science'''

* '''[http://www.eurekalert.org/pubnews.php?view=titles EurekAlert]''' - Current science and technology press releases. Often a day earlier and unmodified by journalists.


'''Specific Industries'''

* '''[http://www.aviationweek.com/HomePage.aspx Aviation Week]''' - Aerospace industry news, including space projects.
* '''[http://www.automationworld.com/ Automation World]''' - Manufacturing automation.
* '''[http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/latest-news EE TImes]''' - Electronics engineering. This link is to the news summary.


==Multiple Documents==

The following sites index, search, or link to multiple documents:

====Library Indexes====

Two steps in finding the current state of knowledge are (1) finding what works exist on a given topic, and (2) locating a copy of the work to look at.  Library indexes help with both steps.

* '''[http://catalog.loc.gov/webvoy.htm Library of Congress Online Catalog]''' - This is an index to the largest single library in the world, including books and periodicals.  Basic search is by title, author, and subject.  Items are shelved and indexed by subject, using a cataloging '''Call Number''' system. If you use the "Call Number Browse" type of search, you can look through all the entries under that subject, which is useful for doing general research on a subject.  The '''[http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/ LC Classification Outline]''' has a summary of the call number system.  For space projects, the headings Q (Science) and T (Technology) are the most relevant, although other sections can be useful depending on the topic.

* '''[http://www.worldcat.org/ WorldCat]''' - This is an online database of the collections of over 10,000 libraries worldwide.  If a work is not available nearby or online, a process of '''Inter-Library Loan''' can be used from a local library to borrow it from another library.

====Online Search====

In addition to well-known search engines such as '''[http://www.google.com/ Google]''' and '''[http://www.bing.com/ Bing]''', there are more specialized searches such as:

* '''[http://scholar.google.com/ Google Scholar]''' - for searching scholarly works
* '''[http://books.google.com/ Google Books]''' - for searching the text of books in general
* '''[[dmoz:Computers/Internet/Searching/Search_Engines/Specialized/| Open Directory Specialized Search Engine List]]''' - Links to many other search websites.

====Online Repositories====

Repositories contain multiple online documents which usually can be downloaded.  In some cases they only index the document online and you then have to request or find a physical copy.

* '''[http://www.mediafire.com/?y1ko8gj5rouob Rocket Science Library]''' - A collection of open source, public domain, and online works compiled in parallel with the development of this book.  A list of additional works is included for ones where copyright restrictions prevent including the document itself.

* '''[http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/search.jsp NASA Technical Reports Server]''' - Access to approximately 1 million documents in NASA databases.
* '''[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/ Defense Technical Information Center]''' - Public access to the unrestricted subset of approximately 2 million US DOD and other technical documents.
* '''[http://patft.uspto.gov/ US Patent and Trademark Office]''' - Search and download patent data.  Patents often contain very useful technical data.
* '''[http://arxiv.org/ arXiv.org]''' - Open access to over 750,000 electronic papers in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology, Quantitative Finance and Statistics. Operated by Cornell University Library.
* '''[ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFullText/ NATO Research and Technology]''' - FTP server of NATO technical and conference reports. Some have relevance to space projects.  It is recommended to find titles and document numbers by other search methods, since the ones here are stored only by their document numbers.
* '''[http://www.nss.org/settlement/index.html National Space Society Library]''' - Online library with multiple space references.
* '''[https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx Defense Acquisition University ACC Practice Center]''' - Multiple documents about how the US government manages projects, including engineering methods in general, and space projects as a topic.

====Early Works====

Although technology has changed drastically since these were written, physics has not, and they serve as a guide to what technical problems need to be solved in any design:

* Bureau of Naval Personnel, '''[http://www.hnsa.org/doc/missile/index.htm Principles of Guided Missiles and Nuclear Weapons]''', 1959.

* Koelle, Heinz Hermann, ed., '''Handbook of Astronautical Engineering''', New York, McGraw-Hill, 1961. - This is an excellent comprehensive reference handbook representing the state of the art as of 1961. Has a chapter covering nuclear, electric, and solar-thermal propulsion.

* Merrill, Grayson, ed. '''Principles of Guided Missile Design''', series, Van Nostrand, 1958. - This is a series of at least 9 volumes with different authors.  Although written in the Cold War nuclear missile era, the technology is relevant to space projects.  Likely much of it will need updating due to being written 50 years ago:

:* Guidance - Locke, Arthur et. al.

==Discussion Forums==

Although online forums are informal, the collective knowledge of the participants is sometimes impressive.  The discussion history can be searched or new questions asked to make use of it.
