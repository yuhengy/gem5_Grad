This is an appraisal of the research article ‘Exercise Training in Treatment and Rehabilitation of Hip Osteoarthritis: A 12-Week Pilot Trial’ (2017) Authors: Uusi-Rasi K, Patil R, Karinkanta S, Tokola K, Kannus P, Sievänen H.



== What is the background to this research? ==
There is general consensus that hip osteoarthritic (OA) pain prospectively leads to surgery without considering alternative routes <ref name=one>Uusi-Rasi K, Patil R, Karinkanta S, Tokola K, Kannus P, Sievänen H.

Similarly, hip OA could benefit from exercise treatment strategies <ref name=one>Uusi-Rasi K, Patil R, Karinkanta S, Tokola K, Kannus P, Sievänen H.

This article examines specific exercise training around the hip to determine its efficacy and compliance.
