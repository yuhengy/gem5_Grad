8 In the early years, the terms “genetic engineering”, “genetic manipulation”, “genetic transformation” and “transgenesis” were favored to describe the techniques of genetic modification. R.L. Paarlberg, The Politics of Precaution (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 2.

Plants are also now being developed to mine precious metals (e.g., Brassica, which is being developed to concentrate gold from the soil in their leaves). Science and Government, No. 1, June 2002, 3.

24 A number of scientists have called for the use the term “nuclear transplantation”, instead of “therapeutic cloning”, to help reduce public confusion. The term “cloning” has become synonymous with “somatic cell nuclear transfer”, a procedure that can be used for a variety of purposes, only one of which involves an intention to create a clone of an organism. They believe that the term “cloning” is best associated with the ultimate outcome or objective of the research and not the mechanism or technique used to achieve that objective. They argue that the goal of creating a nearly identical genetic copy of a human being is consistent with the term “human reproductive cloning”, but the goal of creating stem cells for regenerative medicine is not consistent with the term “therapeutic cloning”. The objective of the latter is to make tissue that is genetically compatible with that of the recipient, not to create a copy of the potential tissue recipient. Hence, “therapeutic cloning” is conceptually inaccurate. B. Vogelstein, B. Alberts, and K. Shine, “Please Don’t Call It Cloning!”, Science (15 February 2002), 1237.

However, there is wide disagreement within scientific circles whether human cloning can be successfully carried out. For instance, Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch of Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research believes that reproductive cloning shortcuts basic biological processes, thus making normal offspring impossible to produce. In normal fertilization, the egg and sperm go through a long process of maturation. Cloning shortcuts this process by trying to reprogram the nucleus of one whole genome in minutes or hours. This results in gross physical malformations to subtle neurological disturbances. Cameron, supra note 30.

61 Available from http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk. The Royal Society is the national academy of sciences of the United Kingdom. It is the oldest scientific academy in existence, having been founded in 1660. Composed of eminent scientists who have been elected for life by peer review as fellows, the Society counts at least 65 Nobel Laureates among its approximately 1300 Fellows and Foreign Members. It is independent of government by virtue of a royal charter granted in 1663. It produces a series of authoritative statements and reports that provide advice to the UK government and the public on key issues in science and technology. In 1998, it issued the report Genetically Modified Plants for Food Use, which it updated in February 2002 with the issuance of the report Genetically Modified Plants for Food Use and Human Health — An Update.

The Royal Society noted, however, that in current screening methods, applicable to both conventional and GM foods, there is no formal assessment of the allergenic risks posed by inhalation of pollen or dusts. It recommended that decision trees be expanded to include inhalant as well as food allergies. Id.

72 World investment in public agricultural research grew steadily from the 1950s to the 1980s. This led to the Green Revolution, which spread high-yield seeds to developing countries in the 1960s and 1970s. However, publicly funded research stagnated in the 1990s. This meant that just when modern biotechnology was showing promise in rural agricultural development, the key funders have halted the momentum of investment in agricultural research and extension programs that help train farmers in the latest techniques.

This has adversely affected public research institutes in countries like Kenya and Zimbabwe, which are funded mainly by donor contributions. The donor share in public research funding in Kenya and Zimbabwe accounted for an average of 67% and 50% of total expenditures, respectively. C.A.
