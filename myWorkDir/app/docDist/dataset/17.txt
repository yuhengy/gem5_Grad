==[[w:1860|1860]]==
One of the most prosperous stores in 1860 was that of '''Ephraim Chamberlain''', located "under the hill" on the northeast side of the four corners.  He dealt in general merchandise, groceries, etc.  In those days the merchants bought their goods in [[w:New York City|New York City]] or [[w:Utica, New York|Utica]] or [[w:Albany, New York|Albany]], but principally in the last named city.  They would go twice a year to the city and buy enough stock to last six months.  Much teaming was done during these years between Edmeston and Albany, over the [[w:Great Western Turnpike|Great Western Turnpike]] a state built¹ road from Albany to [[w:Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] and [[w:Bath, New York|Bath]] via [[w:Cherry Valley, New York|Cherry Valley]] [[w:Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]], Edmeston and [[w:Sherburne, New York|Sherburne]]. This journey required over a week.  — [[History of Edmeston, New York/References#Hazel L. Jones|''Hazel L. Jones'']]

The following excerpt is from the '''''[[w:Gazetteer|Gazetteer]] of the State of New York''''' by J. H. French. Published by R. Pearsall Smith [[w:Syracuse, New York|Syracuse, N.Y.]] 1860.

:'''''EDMESTON''''' -- was formed from [[w:Burlington, New York|Burlington]], April 1, 1808. It lies upon the W. border of the co., N. of the center. The surface is elevated upland, broken by numerous irregular valleys. The highest elevations are 400 to 500 ft. above [[w:Unadilla River|Unadilla River]], which forms the W. boundary. [[w:Wharton Creek|Wharton Creek]] flows across the S. E. corner. Mill Creek and several other small streams take their rise in the town. Smiths Pond is a small sheet of water in the N. E. corner. The soil is a sandy and clayey loam. Edmeston Center (Edmeston p.o.) contains 3 churches, a grist and saw mill, and tannery. Pop. 275. [[w:West Edmeston, New York|West Edmeston]], ([[w:postal village|p.v.]],) on Unadilla River, and partly in Brookfield, (Madison co.,) contains a church and 35 houses. [[w:South Edmeston, New York|South Edmeston]], ([[w:postal village|p.v.]],) on the Unadilla, contains 30 houses. Of the first settlement in town, authentic data of the precise date are wanting. It was made, however, on Unadilla River, during the interval between the close of the French War, in 1763, and the commencement of that of the Revolution, in 1775, by Col. Edmeston, an officer of the French War, and [[w:Percifer Carr|Percifer Carr]], a faithful soldier who had served under him.¹ The first church (Bap.) was formed at [[w:Taylor Hill|Taylor Hill]], March 8, 1794; Rev. Stephen Taylor was the first preacher.²

:#At the close of the war, [[w:William Edmeston|Col. Edmeston]], for his military services, received the grant of a tract of land covering a large portion of the town on which he made the first settlement. At his death the lands fell to heirs and minor children residing in England, from whom no safe title could be obtained for many years, &mdash; which greatly retarded the settlement of the town.  During the [[w:American Revolution|American Revolution]], the hired men of Mr. Carr were killed while at work, his barn burned, his property destroyed, and himself and family were taken prisoners by the [[w:United Kingdom|British]] and Indians and detained to the close of the war. '''Abel De Forest''' and '''Gideon De Forest''' were among the early settlers on the Unadilla; '''Aden Deming''' and '''James Kenada''', at Edmeston; and '''Stephen Taylor''', on Taylor Hill, where the first school was taught. '''Rufus Graves''' kept the first inn; and James Kenada erected the first gristmill, both at Edmeston Center.

Patent Claims Issued from the United States Patent Office for the week ending January 10, 1860:

:26,743. — '''Levi A. Beardsley''', of South Edmeston, N. Y., for an Improvement in Hop Frames:

:I claim the employment of a frame holder composed of a sliding box, K, with a windlass or seller to tighten the wire, and a vertical bed or strip, G, to guide or support the box. K. substantially as and or the purpose shown and described.

HOP FRAMES

This invention relates to a device for lowering the vines and bringing them within reach, for the facility of gathering the hops, and then for elevating them again to their original position, keeping the horizontal cords or wires, upon which the vines are entwined, under tension all the time. This invention consists in attaching to the posts a vertical strip with a small grooved pulley in its top over which passes a cord, which is attached to a sliding box for elevating and depressing this box, and to this sliding box is connected a yoke provided with a hook which hooks into an eye or loop on the end of the wires forming the frame upon which wires the vines are twined; the object being to tighten up these wires, and to keep them under tension while raising and lowering them. '''L. A. Beardsley''', of Edmeston, N. Y., is the patentee. &mdash; [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?root=%2Fmoa%2Fscia%2Fscia1002%2F&tif=00062.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABF2204-1002-6&coll=moa&frames=1&view=100 Scientific American/New Series, Volume 2, Issue 4, Pub.

MAGNETIZED WHEELS OF LOCOMOTIVES &mdash; A TIMELY HINT TO INVENTORS,

MESSRS. EDITORS: &mdash; When I notice the experiments that have been tried to make the driving wheels of a locomotive adhere to the rails by the application of magnetism to the wheels, I wonder why I did not put forth a suggestion noted down in my private journal, under date of March 21, 1848. But I have now to regret, like many other inventors, the folly of procrastination. The entry in my journal reads thus: &mdash; "Would a magnetized wheel rolling on a soft iron bar not slip, yet roll with ease; the driving wheels of a locomotive, for instance, being so covered with coils of wire that a portion or the whole of the circumference of it will be magnetized?" I send you this to show that this invention was thought of some time prior to the claims of the present inventor, and for the forcible warning it gives to every inventor to secure, by Letters Patent, every good improvement as soon as it is made. '''L. A. B.''' South Edmeston, N. Y., Jan. 31, 1860.  &mdash; [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fscia%2Fscia1002%2F&tif=00122.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABF2204-1002-10 Scientific American/New Series, Volume 2, Issue 8, Pub.
