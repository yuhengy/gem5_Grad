== Wiki Exercise #1: Online Visibility and Footprint ==

I can say that I am visible online, as I use many and different social networking. The social networking that I use Instagram,  Facebook, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Twitter, Gmail, Google+, YouTube and Amazon Prime. These are the social networks I use.

The most I use Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. I use Instagram to share for my personal information like my photos and videos and all my updates. My Instagram account is public, so I can share my details with anyone in the world.

Apart from Instagram, the most social network, I use is Facebook. I use it to chat with my family members and those who don’t use Instagram. Also, use it for my photos and videos and all my updates and I will use my Facebook for some updates about my favorite actors as well.

I barely use Twitter, I use twitter only to find the updates of my Uni (University of Stirling). I use Gmail to contact with all my personal details for example, updates from my GP appointments, updates from my bank account, update from some of my who don’t have any social media accounts and also, I apply for many part-time jobs by using my Gmail address so to get updates from the jobs and many more. I can say that I use it for my career purpose. In the same way, I use Google+.

I use WhatsApp to contact with my close friends and my family. I use to make calls, video calls and many more. The main I use it for my family. I use Snapchat as well just for time pass also to update everything about me like what am I doing or where I am and many about me. Also, I find know the updates from my friends like what are they doing or where are they. I also use YouTube and Amazon Prime to watch movies I like to.

But the most I use Instagram Facebook and WhatsApp these are the three social networks I use the most and you can find me anytime. I prefer to avoid many accounts on different platforms. At the moment I have deleted all my social network applications on my phone as part of my new year resolution but I only use WhatsApp and Facebook at the moment. 

Well coming to my Collaborative Essay work I am doing Digital Labour. As per me, it’s an interesting topic and that is related to our online visibility and footprint. We all know many people work online in their daily life for example, to Google or Facebook and to store their private details. So, there are many ways to be visibility online. I conclude that it is smarter to share as some information as could reasonably be expected.[[User:Ala Venkat|Ala Venkat]] ([[User talk:Ala Venkat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ala Venkat|contribs]]) 09:55, 1 March 2019 (UTC)

===Instructor Feedback on Wiki Exercise #1===

Posts and comments on other people’s work, of this standard, roughly corresponds to the following grade descriptor. Depending on where your actual mark is in relation to the making criteria as outlined in the relevant documentation, it should give you an idea of strengths and weaknesses within the achieved grade band overall:

:::Good. Among other things, good entries will make a clear point in a clear way. They will relate concepts to original examples in a straightforward fashion. They will make effective use of the possibilities of the form (including links, as well as perhaps copyright-free videos and images, linked to from Wiki Commons). They may also demonstrate a broader understanding of the module's themes and concerns, and are likely to show evidence of reading and thinking about the subject material. The wiki markup formatting will be very clear.

:::This work is at the lower end of this grade band, so there’s clearly room for improvement here. I think in order to engage with the wiki exercises a bit more, it might be useful for you to look at the Grade Descriptors and criteria in the module handbook to get more of an idea of how to hit those targets. Less instrumentally, and more in relation to this particular post, making more use of the wiki functionality and markup would have gone a long way to improving fluidity and functionality of posts. I suspect that, if you become more familiar and proficient with the platform, that this would have made a considerable difference.

:::Re: responses to other people’s posts – none undertaken. This would effectively halve your mark in assessed work.

== Wiki Exercise #2: To what extent are my online and offline identities aligned?  ==

I am an online person I use different social networking so, I can say that I am visible online, as I use many and different social networking. The social networking that I use Instagram,  Facebook, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Twitter, Gmail, Google+, YouTube and Amazon Prime. These are the social networks I use. The most I use Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. I use Instagram to share for my personal information like my photos and videos and all my updates. My Instagram account is public, so I can share my details with anyone in the world. Apart from Instagram, the most social network, I use is Facebook. I use it to chat with my family members and those who don’t use Instagram. Also, use it for my photos and videos and all my updates and I will use my Facebook for some updates about my favourite actors as well. I also believe that my online identity does not differ from my offline identity. All the content that I publish in the social networks (such as Facebook or Instagram) that I use represents me. I do not pretend to be something that I am not to be online.
[[File:Instagram logo 2016.svg|right|thumb|[[Image]] of Instagram]]

I can say that my online identity has been changed over my years on the internet as it has matured along with me. Also, I took a challenge not be visible online for at least a year, but I was completely offline for 2 years which I feel very proud. Now, I was completely changed I am not addicted to any social media or mobile phones etc. I have 4 to 5 identities on social media. My current online identity to chat with my close friend and my family. Some of the friends used to lie and show their identity in social media when they need to.
 
[[File:Social media icons.jpg|left|thumb|[[Image]] about Social Media]]

When I was offline then I never used to think about any social media I just used to spend all my time with my family members and my friends also, I used to keep myself very busy so with that I can avoid being in online I can say that it was one of the quite interesting experience for me. When I started being online than slowly I used to avoid my friends and also, I used to not spend spent with my family but now I realised and again I am trying to be offline but now it’s quite difficult to buy for sure I will do that in future.

I conclude, all these are the things I have done. So, it will be quiet interesting if you are not visible online for ages and you will get to know what is the mistake we are doing by spending our whole time in social media and stuff I share something to the internet my thoughts and intentions behind it are in the court of public opinion. These all are my thoughts and I have faced with all of these.

== Wiki Exercise #3: Annotated Bibliography part B ==

Trebor Scholz (2016). Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy. Polity Press, 2016-12-05,p.23-50 

The book by Trebor Scholz. Toward a typology of digital labour in a media, as per the book typology of digital labour is closely examine the practices like crowdsourcing, pain in-game labour, and content farming. The Trebor Scholz utilize the digital labour meeting as their main research focus just as investigating guidelines in different nations. According to my own research on the digital economy, which this book has much information about the digital economy. I can say this help me with my research about the digital economy. This book is more about workers are disrupting the digital economy. It also showed the digital labour platforms and “new vectors of the production of wealth”. The article spins around the digital workers likewise this article will be utilized to demonstrate the digital economy of digital labour and subsequently, all through the collaborative essay.

==Wiki Exercise #4: Collaborative Essay Critical Evaluation – What ARE Wikis?==
[[File:Wikibooks-logo-en.svg|left|thumb|[[Image]]|WIKIBOOKS]]
<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki</ref>
[[w:Wiki|Wiki]] is a website which helps to know any information. And also wiki users can modify the content and structure directly from the website. The text which is written in the wiki it’s a simplifies mark-up language and it is often edited with a rich-text editor. We all know [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] it’s an online encyclopaedia the most popular wiki-based website it is one of the most widely viewed sites in the world. We also know about [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] it’s a collection of open-content-textbooks. 

<ref>https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks</ref>
[[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] is for textbooks, annotated text, instructional guides and manuals these are included in [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]]. The content in Wikibooks can use for students to their assignments and stuff It can be used in a traditional classroom and this is more used for self-learning. It also includes literary elements like allegory or fables and many more. <ref>(Ravid, M. Kalman & Rafaeli, 2008, p. 1 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563208000265?via%3Dihub)</ref>The production and distribution of traditional textbooks which are influenced by commercial interests. So, the wiki textbooks were developed collaboratively by faculty and my students and it’s free of charge that is available online.

[[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] is a platform which has many good aspects, you can find any information which you get that in textbooks it is more helpful to the students for their research and many more for their own work. But it has a fault, it should create good quality content like [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] and apart from English, it should have any other languages that on books and stuff.  Once this is improved, then [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] will be the great source of knowledge and free to use worldwide, the community will be truly involved in this creation process and [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] also will be very successful like [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]].

In the academic field, [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] it the best resources for every student and now it’s like a tool to promote students to participate in the subject. Has I said they can find any information related to education in [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] it’s the best resource’s website especially for students. Students who developed a textbook article it uses the text which needed, and learned more from the textbook content from the class. So [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] is very useful for the academic field.

[[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] is not an encyclopedia it’s books which build knowledge from one page to next with inter-dependency between pages. But [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] is an online encyclopedia which we can find any information in that.[[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] are classified according to a level of development. It is mainly depending on the topic which we choose the more or fewer manuals you get. There are some stages of development, the simplest is the separate the text and complete the comprehensive text. There more stages so, this stage to allow the reader to be aware of the [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] textbooks that are consulting

A wiki enables communities of editors and contributors to write documents collaboratively. We get any information from the wiki websites. A single in a wiki website is referred to as a “wiki page”. So, the wiki has an entries collection of pages, which are well interconnected by [[w:hyperlinks|hyperlinks]], is “the wiki”.

===INSTRUCTOR FEEDBACK: ENGAGEMENT ON DISCUSSION PAGES & CONTRIBS===

Grade descriptors for Engagement: 
Engagement on discussion pages, and contribs of this standard attain the following grade descriptor. Whereas not all of the elements here will be directly relevant to your particular response to the brief, this descriptor will give you a clearer idea of how the grade you have been given relates to the standards and quality expected of work at this level:
:::'''Poor.''' Among other things, poor contributions may just offer links without real comment or apparent point. They may offer nothing more than poor-quality synopsis or description of material of dubious relevance. They may have serious clarity problems (including dead links, random graphics) which affect comprehension (or even worse, admin warnings or take-down notices for copyright infringement). They might be off-topic, private trivia, or of unclear relevance. The wiki markup formatting will be of a poor standard.

As instructed in the labs, and outlined in the assessment brief documentation, students should be engaging at least once a day, for the duration of the project. The following points illustrate how this engagement is evaluated.

Evidence from '''contribs''' to both editing and discussion of content (i.e. volume and breadth of editorial activity as evidenced through ‘contribs’). These are primarily considered for quality rather than quantity, but as a broad guideline:
::Each item on a contribs list that are 3000+ characters are deemed “considerable”
::Each item on a contribs list that are 2000+ characters are deemed “significant”
::Each item on a contribs list that are 1000+ characters are deemed “substantial”
::Items on a contribs list that are <1000 characters are important, and are considered in the round when evaluating contribs as a whole because of their aggregate value

'''Overall:'''
:::'''minimal'''

Engagement with and learning from the community on '''Discussion Pages'''
::Evidence of peer-assisted learning and collaboration
:::'''Poor'''
::Evidence of reading, sharing, and application of research to the essay
:::'''Good'''
::Evidence of peer-review of others’ work
:::'''little in evidence here'''
Reflexive, creative and well-managed use of Discussion Pages
::Clear delegation of tasks
:::'''little in evidence here'''
::Clearly labelled sections and subsections
:::'''Satisfactory'''
::Contributions are all signed
:::'''Satisfactory'''
Civility. Your conduct is a key component of any collaboration, especially in the context of an online knowledge-building community. Please respect others, as well as observe the rules for civility on wiki projects. All contribs are moderated.
:::'''Good'''

{{reply to|Ala Venkat}}

Posts and comments on other people’s work, of this standard, roughly correspond to the following grade descriptor. Depending on where your actual mark is in relation to the making criteria as outlined in the relevant documentation, it should give you an idea of strengths and weaknesses within the achieved grade band overall:

:::Satisfactory. Among other things, satisfactory entries may try to relate an idea from the module to an original example, but might not be very convincing. They may waste space on synopsis or description, rather than making a point. They may have spelling or grammatical errors and typos. They might not demonstrate more than a single quick pass at the assignment, informed only by lecture and/or cursory reading. They may suggest reading but not thinking (or indeed the reverse). The wiki markup formatting will need some work.

:::Re: responses to other people’s posts – these are fairly good, if a little brief, and you omit the final response to Wiki Ex4, which was a crucial oversight on your part. Remember that the comments are "worth" as much as posts themselves. The reason for this is not only to help encourage discussion (a key element of wiki collaboration!) but also to get you to reflect upon your own work. General:
:::Reading and research: evidence of critical engagement with set materials; evidence of independent reading of appropriate academic and peer-reviewed material

:::Argument and analysis: well-articulated and well-supported argument - yes; evidence of critical thinking (through taking a position in relation to key ideas from the module, and supporting this position) - yes; evidence of relational thinking (through making connections between key ideas from the module and wider literature, and supporting these connections) - ok; evidence of independent critical ability - ok

:::Presentation: good use of wiki markup and organisational skills.
