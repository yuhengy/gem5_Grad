# Expansion of happiness is the purpose of life, and evolution is the process by which it is fulfilled. Life begins in a natural way, it evolves, and happiness expands. The expansion of happiness carries with it the growth of intelligence, power, creativity and everything that may be said to be of significance in life.  
# The purpose of individual life is also the purpose of the life of the entire cosmos. The purpose of creation is the expansion of happiness which is fulfilled through the process of cosmic evolution. The significance and purpose of individual life is the same as that of the life of the cosmos. The difference lies in the scale. 
# The individual life is the basic unit of the life of the cosmos. Evolution of the cosmos is basically served by the evolution the individual life. Thus, if the purpose of individual life is served, the purpose of cosmic life is also served spontaneously and simultaneously to that degree and on that scale. 
# If one has fulfilled the purpose of his own life, he has done his best to help the cosmic purpose. 
# If one is not happy, one has lost the very purpose of life. If one is not constantly developing his intelligence, power, creativity, peace, and happiness, then he has lost the very purpose of life. Life is not meant to be lived in dullness, idleness, and suffering; these do not belong to the essential nature of life. 
# Life is dynamic, not static. It is energetic, progressing, evolving, developing through activity, and multiplying itself. The nature and purpose of life is progress, evolution, activity, and improvement. 
# Activity maintains the stream of evolution, and the physical vehicle that is responsible for activity is the nervous system of the individual. In species lower than man the nervous system is not so fully evolved and so the activity leading to evolution is on a much smaller scale. The activity of the lower species, while carrying out the process of evolution, does not produce a high degree of evolution. As the nervous system evolves, the rate of evolution increases. 
# Man's nervous system is the most highly evolved. Therefore, the scope of evolution of man is unlimited in this life. We note how, when a child is born, his intelligence, power, and creativity are low, but as he grows he indulges in the field of activity where his power is great, his intelligence is great, his creativity is great, and the degree of happiness which he experiences in himself and projects outside himself is great. The nervous system is developed to the extent that through proper activity (the revelation of which is the purpose of this book) the man can contact absolute bliss, creativity, intelligence, power, and energy.  
# To live a life of freedom is the purpose of life in the human species. If one is not able to live such a life, the very purpose of life is blurred. Man is born to live a perfect life holding within its range all values of the transcendental absolute divine of unlimited energy, intelligence, power, peace and bliss along with the unlimited values of the world of multiplicity in relative existence. He is born to project the abundance of the absolute state of life into the world of relative existence. 
# Man's life is meant to be a bridge of abundance between divine intelligence and the whole of creation. Man's life is to cultivate and give--cultivate the divine power, intelligence, happiness and abundance, and give it out to all of creation. This is the high purpose of the life of man, and it is fortunate to find that every man is capable of reaching this by improving the conscious capacity of his mind and consciously contacting the field of the absolute energy, peace, happiness, and abundance of the eternal, divine consciousness. 
# Every man is capable of spreading the divine splendor in the whole creation. He is able to project all values of the absolute into the world of relative existence for all creatures to enjoy and to glorify the entire creation of God. Each man is capable of living a life of full values. If one fails to live it, it is a disgrace to oneself, and it abuses the glory of almighty God within and above us. 
# Here is an invitation for every man on earth to start picking up the divine consciousness of the absolute, and, bringing it through all his activity into the world of variety, enjoy it himself and project it for all others to enjoy as well. 
# A man projecting himself out in the world through a limited mind is not able to appreciate the real purpose of life. With a small capacity of mind, he engages himself in doing little things of which he thinks in very limited terms. He can engage himself in very limited activity. He can create only a limited number of small things of limited value. The conscious mind of an ordinary man is so limited that he is not even able to enjoy life. He is found to be suffering for the most part on many levels of his life. This state of suffering is merely due to his not using his full potential. 
# By not using his full potential, man is not able to fulfill the purpose of his life. He is found suffering in many ways because he is not using the full conscious capacity of his mind; he is not using the great energy he carries within himself. He is not experiencing and expressing in his life the abundance of absolute bliss that he naturally possesses, the great absolute field of creativity and power that he has within himself. He is like a millionaire who has forgotten his wealth and status and who goes begging in the street and every moment feels the lack of money. 
# All suffering is due to not knowing a way to unfold the divine glory present within oneself. Lack of ... Not having the capacity for divine unfoldment, the ignorance of a technique for diving within oneself is responsible for the misery in life. Without divine consciousness, man is found lacking in energy, intelligence, and clear thinking. He is tired, tense and anxious. 
# This state of human existence and human intelligence have come to such a deplorable condition that from the field of psychology--the great science of the mind--it is found suggested that tension is necessary for creative intelligence. What a shame it is to believe that tension is necessary to improve life! 
# It is said that poets and artists have created their inspiring literature and art under tension. All such statements come from ignorance and from an inability to release tensions. 
# Our modern scientific age unfortunately is increasing in tension. The individual life seems to be growing in tension instead of growing in ease and comfort, even though material comforts certainly are increasing. This is only because the individuals have no way of improving their ability and efficiency through contact with the greater energy and intelligence that every man has within himself. It is only necessary to consciously contact that field of inner life and profit by it.  
# The man of today is blind to the purpose of life, not able to see that he is born to enjoy, create, and live a life useful to himself and others. He plunges into whatever activity lies ahead, working hard to put forth his best effort in that field. It is commendable to work hard for things; to be creative in any aspect of life is what man is here for. But when activity increases, a man often finds himself unable to cope with the increased pressure. His efficiency declines, or he does not find energy enough to cope with the increased activity. This is why tension and strain develop. 
# As a man engages in greater activity he should be able to produce more energy and greater intelligence within himself to deal with this increased activity. This he does not know how to do, and, therefore, he loses the entire purpose of life. </td>
