'''Saphira''' (pronounced "suh-FEAR-uh"), also known as '''Saphira II''' (used by fans to distinguish between the two [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Races/Dragon|dragons]] named "Saphira" in the books, the other being the dragon formerly bonded with [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Brom|Brom]]), '''Flametongue''' by the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Races/Urgal|Urgals]], as well as''' Bjartskular''' (meaning "Brightscales" in the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Culture/Ancient Language|Ancient Language]]) by the elves, was the only female dragon known to exist during the time of [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Eragon|Eragon]], aside from [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Culture/Eldunarí|Eldunarí]]. She was bonded to [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Eragon|Eragon Shadeslayer]] as her [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Races/Dragon RiderDragon Rider]] after her [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Objects/Dragon egg|egg]] was rescued by the [[Varden]]'s agents from the clutches of [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Galbatorix|Galbatorix]] and was transported to [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/The Spine|the Spine]] by [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Arya|Arya]], where Eragon found her. She was trained by [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Glaedr|Glaedr]] while Eragon was being trained by [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Oromis|Oromis]]. Eventually Oromis, Glaedr, Saphira and Eragon started having classes together than finally Eragon and Saphira had to leave.

== History ==
Saphira was the only bonded egg given to the riders from the mating of [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Iormûngr|Iormûngr]], a male dragon bound to a Dragon Rider, as well as [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Vervada|Vervada]], a wild female dragon. Both dragons perished during the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Events/Fall of the Dragon Riders|Fall of the Dragon Riders]]. Saphira's sapphire-blue colored egg, along with two others (emerald green and ruby red) were found and taken by Galbatorix during the Fall. Galbatorix tried desperately to find a Rider for whom the eggs would hatch, but was unsuccessful. None of the dragons responded to the touch of anyone in the [[Broddring Empire]]. Later in Galbatorix's reign, a former Rider known as [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Brom|Brom]] and a scholar named [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Jeod|Joed]] discovered a secret entrance into [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Urû'baen|Urû'baen]]. The Varden appointed a thief, [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Hefring|Hefring]], to steal the eggs. However, he only took one egg (Saphira's egg) and he kept it, all the while, running from Brom. The egg was later taken from him by [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Morzan|Morzan]], who might have slain Hefring. Brom eventually tracked down and killed Morzan and [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Morzan's Dragon|Morzan's Dragon]], thus recovering the egg for the Varden. The egg was then transported back and forth from the Varden to the kingdom of the elves [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Du Weldenvarden|Du Weldenvarden]], in the hope that the Dragon would eventually hatch. The egg-courier was Arya, daughter of [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Islanzadí|Islanzadí]], the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Races/Elf|Elf]] [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Culture/Queen|queen]]. Unfortunately, the egg didn't hatch.

=== Role in ''[[User:Artix Kreiger/Eragon|Eragon]]'' ===
After fifteen years, Galbatorix sent the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Culture/Shade|Shade]] [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Durza|Durza]] to ambush Arya. Arya was captured and her two companions murdered, but not before she successfully teleported the egg towards [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Carvahall|Carvahall]], where she hoped it would reach Brom. However, the Eldunarí in the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Vault of Souls|Vault of Souls]], which is in [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Doru Araeba|Doru Araeba]] (on [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Vroengard|Vroengard]]), changed the flow of [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Magic|Magic]] so that Saphira's egg would appear to Eragon instead—the dragons thought that Saphira might hatch for Eragon and they were growing restless waiting for Galbatorix to be overthrown. Before they reach [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Vroengard|Vroengard]], they thought that [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Arya|Arya]] had accidentally sent her to [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Eragon|Eragon]], as they were very similar in character.

The egg was found by Eragon while he was hunting in the mysterious mountain range known as [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/The Spine|the Spine]]. Eragon first mistook it for a blue stone of great value. A few days later, Saphira hatched for him. When Eragon touched the newborn dragon, his right palm burned suddenly and sent an icy feeling through out him. This gave him the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Culture/Gedwëy ignasia|gedwëy ignasia]], the mark of a Dragon Rider. Their minds were linked mentally and almost immediately they were able to communicate with images and feelings.

Saphira and Eragon's bond grew stronger with time as they escaped from Carvahall with Brom to hunt the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Races/Ra'zac|Ra'zac]] for vengeance after the murder of [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Garrow|Garrow]], Eragon's uncle. Later, with [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Murtagh|Murtagh]]'s help, Saphira rescued Eragon from an Imperial prison in [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Gil'ead|Gil'ead]]. Eragon found the elf who was really Arya whom he had seen in his sleep. They fled to the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Beor Mountains|Beor Mountains]] in search of the Varden. After a long journey through the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Hadarc Desert|Hadarac Desert]] and being chased by [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Races/Kull|the Urgals known as Kull]], they arrived at [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Farthen Dûr|Farthen Dûr]]: capital of the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Races/Dwarf|Dwarves]] and hiding place of the Varden. There, Saphira and Eragon met [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Ajihad|Ajihad]], leader of the Varden, who offered them shelter from the Broddring Empire. Soon, a legion of Urgals under Durza's command attacked Farthen Dûr. After a long battle, the Varden were victorious.

=== Role in ''[[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Eldest|Eldest]]'' ===
In Eldest, Saphira and Eragon travel to Du Weldenvarden to continue their training. Because of the guilt the elves felt due to the Fall of the Dragon Riders, Saphira was treasured among the elves. She and Eragon were there taught by Glaedr, a surviving dragon and his Rider Oromis (Known as The Mourning Sage and The Cripple Who is Whole) Some of the elves were spiteful and mean. They said they thought a man not a boy would save them. Their training was interrupted when Eragon and Saphira flew to the aid of the Varden and fought in the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Events/Battle of the Burning Plains|Battle of the Burning Plains]]. During the battle, Eragon and Saphira were defeated by the new Rider and Dragon, Murtagh and [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Thorn|Thorn]]. Exploiting a loophole of Galbatorix's orders, Murtagh spared Eragon and Saphira, on account of their former friendship and family ties. He did however kill [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Hrothgar|Hrothgar]], the dwarf King, and cause Eragon a great deal of anguish. Then, he reclaimed Zar'roc since it was rightfully his by birth before departing with Thorn.

=== Role in ''[[Brisingr]] '' ===
In ''Brisingr,'' Saphira, Eragon and [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Character/Roran|Roran]] went to [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Places/Helgrind|Helgrind]] to kill the Ra'zac and [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Races/Lethrblaka|Lethrblaka]], as well as rescue Roran's beloved, Katrina. Saphira was forced to separate from Eragon when he found [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Sloan|Sloan]] and decided to spare his life. Saphira flew Roran and [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Katrina|Katrina]] back to the Varden, while Eragon traveled across a significant portion of [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Alagaësia|Alagaësia]]. Upon returning to the Varden, [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Nasuada|Nasuada]] sent him to Farthen Dûr to help oversee the appointment of the new dwarven monarch. After [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Orik|Orik]] was appointed king by the Clanmeet, Saphira joined Eragon in Farthen Dûr to honour Orik as king in the public ceremony and give the dwarves the gift that she owed them: repairing the Isidar Mithrim (star sapphire) which she and Arya had shattered when they flew to Eragon's aid in his battle with the Shade, Durza. Saphira and Eragon then flew to Du Weldenvarden to complete their training with Oromis and Glaedr. Here, Glaedr revealed that dragons possessed a heart of hearts, also known as an [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Culture/Eldunarí|Eldunarí]]. Dragons could place their consciousness in it if they so chose. Saphira helped Eragon gather the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Culture/Brightsteel|brightsteel]] from under the [[Menoa Tree]] (by attacking it) so he and [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Rhunön|Rhunön]] could forge [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Objects/Brisingr (Sword)|Brisingr]], Eragon's new sword. Glaedr gave Saphira and Eragon his heart of hearts, which they promised to safeguard. Saphira and Eragon joined the Varden's Siege at [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Feinster]], aiding the Varden in their victory. During a separate battle at Gil'ead, Glaedr and Oromis were killed by Murtagh and Thorn, who were possessed by Galbatorix.

=== Role in ''[[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Inheritance|Inheritance]]'' ===
In ''Inheritance'', Saphira was almost fatally wounded by a [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Objects/Dauthdaert|Dauthdaert]] at [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Belatona|Belatona]]. She carried Eragon and Glaedr to the island of Vroengard through a fierce storm, using a [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Culture/Magic/Breathing Spell|breathing spell]] to survive. On the island, she, together with Eragon, found their true names and entered the [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Locations/Rock of Kuthian|Rock of Kuthian]] with Glaedr. Saphira was overjoyed by the revelation of the secret Eldunarí and dragon eggs.

She took part in the battle with [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Galbatorix|Galbatorix]], battling [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Shruikan|Shruikan]] with Thorn so that Arya could utilize the Dauthdaert. She gave energy to Eragon when he did the spell to defeat Galbatorix.

Saphira and Eragon helped to restore order in the chaos after Galbatorix's death but eventually decided that the best course of action would be to take eggs and Eldunarí with them, away from Alagaësia.

After [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Fírnen|Fírnen]], the emerald green dragon and last of Galbitorix's eggs hatched for Arya, he and Saphira fell in love. Saphira mated with Fírnen after a courtship ritual.

Saphira carried Roran, Katrina, as well as their [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Ismira Katrinasdaughter|daughter]] to [[User:Artix Kreiger/Inheritance Cycle/Characters/Ellesméra|Ellesméra]] and then left Alagaësia with Eragon to rebuild the Dragon Riders.
