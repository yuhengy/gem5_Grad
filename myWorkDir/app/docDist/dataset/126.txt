I got my placement this week in NC, at a school like five minutes from my house so I'm really excited. Now I just have to wait on the principal to call me back so I know when to go. [[User:Mfarr015|Mfarr015]] ([[User talk:Mfarr015|talk]]) 15:43, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
I know that you are going to be a wonderful teacher. You sound like you are such the loving person. I believe that kids at a young age need a lot of love and attention in order for them to enjoy school. I had to comment because I am the same way with my animals. When I moved out of my mom's house we had two dogs and two cats and a 50 gallon fish tank. Now that I am not at home I still have a pit bull, a 20 gallon fish tank, and a 4 1/2ft boa. I have always loved my animals. Anyway I believe that you are going to be a wonderful teacher, go get it. [[User:Dfoun002|Dfoun002]] ([[User talk:Dfoun002|talk]]) 02:40, 3 February 2009 (UTC)



==Thanks==

Great work on this user page.  Jamie and I played around with your pictures for a while, and I think we have them looking pretty good.  Thanks for taking the time to put so much work and effort into this page.  Messing with your code taught me a couple things.  Hope you have a great day, and let me know if I can help you with anything.

I like your Simpsons Caricature !

Hey Jessica. I definately remember you from our english class. I'm taking the class on campus. I love your graphics and pictures, all of the animals are so cute.

I love your Simpsons girl too! I think your Maine Coon cat is awesome. I have 3 cats myself: an orange tabby, black tabby, and a solid black. [[User:Kbroo025|Kbroo025]] ([[User talk:Kbroo025|talk]]) 01:19, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
