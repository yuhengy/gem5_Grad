'''EDITORIAL'''

Journalism is one of the surest ways to fame and fortune. During the past twenty years I have had the pleasure of seeing many people succeed in life directly or indirectly on account of their literary efforts. There was Dr. Barry, who did music criticism for the old "Wireless Weekly." The last I heard of him he was Director of Programmes for the A.B.C. Then I remember Bob McCall, who signed himself as "Discobolus" at the foot of a page of record criticisms in the old "Weekly." In almost no time he was in charge of recorded music at the A.B.C., then Manager for Victoria and away to England for further promotion. The Discobolus page was taken over by Greg Spencer, and sure enough he too climbed the ladder of fame until his untimely death recently. Lahm did comic drawings for me long before he became famous for Snifter in "Man." Wep did the Humperdink series as one of his stepping stones to fame. You know him now if you read the "Women's Weekly." I could go on indefinitely with the names of dozens I knew when they were keen to succeed. They had the ability; they showed it in black and white; it w as recognised; now they are on top. Yet how difficult it is to get anyone to try their hand at writing a technical article. In last month’s issue I called for applications for the position of editorial representative in Sydney. Hundreds of replies were received; most of them mentioning how much they would like to take up journalism, yet apparently not one of them had ever submitted anything for publication, let alone get it published. Wouldn’t it? — '''A. G. HULL.'''

NOTES FROM MY DIARY
S u n s p o t s
Dr. John Q. Stewart, astronomer
of Princeton University, U.S.A.,
says: "Sunspots— some as big as the
earth—w ill continue to disrupt
radio for at least another year. Even
then the respite w ill be brief for
one spot cycle is no more completed than another one begins. It
usually takes about 11 years for the
maximum to he reached. Dr. Stewart predicts that the present cycle
w ill reach its maximum by about
the end of 1947.—Radio News.
" R a d io A u s t r a l i a ”
I have received a very fine
double-sided pamphlet from the
Department of Information, M elbourne, setting out in splendid
form the various, programmes,
schedules and transmitters used by
"Radio Australia.” In this issue I
am showing the call-signs, frequencies and times on the air and
it is hoped space w ill be available
in March issue for the various features. The whole set-up compares
more than favourably with anything from overseas and it is
printed all ready for posting, so
should be a splendid advertisement
for Australia.
I n t e r n a t i o n a l S h o r t w a v e
I was very pleased and proud to
receive a card from Kenneth R.
Boord, shortwave editor of "Radio
News,” appointing me as monitor
for international shortwave during
the year 1946-7. "Radio News” is
one of — if not—the best American
magazines dealing with radio. It is
profusely illustrated and contains
most informative notes on shortwave.
SAYS WHO?
'''Arthur Cushen''' of Invercargill, N.Z., reports three • nice verifications: LJK, Oslo, 9.54mc, 31.45m:
this was in the form of a nice card
showing photo of Oslo across the
harbour. They state they are using
5K W and relay Norwegian N ational Programmes from 5-5.15
p.m.; 8.45-10.30 p.m.; 2-8 a.m.
There are no regular English broadcasts at present. This verification
by the way took a little over a year
to arrive . . . Cushen’s report was
dated October 13, 1945. Another
was from CE622, Santiago, 6.22
me, 48.23m. This verification took
the form of a letter in Spanish
signed by F. Elisso Merino B,
Casilla 2626, Santiago. Power is
5000 watts. (Slogan of this station
is "Radio Sociedad Nacional de
M ineria.”-—L .J.K .) The final was
from Paris for reports on 9.985mc
and 11.845mc.—L.J.K.
* * *
'''Rex Gillett''' of Adelaide is also proud of his veries and considers the best received for some time is KOFA, Salzburg, 7.22mc, 41.55m. This United States Forces station in Austria uses a power of 725 watts. The manager of the station, Mel. London, said in answer to Rex’s question, "Am I the first Australian to pick you up and report the fact?” "The answer is definitely YES and
we are quite proud of your report because, although we have been picked up all over the United States and most of Europe, yours is the first from down under’.” Another good verie received on
Boxing Day was ZNB, Mafeking, Bechuanaland, 5.900mc, 50.85m. Mr. A. P. Brittz, the station’s technician, in verifying Mr. Gillett’s report stated that ZNB is NOT a broadcasting station. "It is primarily the control station for numerous communication stations upcountry in the Bechuanaland Protectorate where there is no telephone communication or telegraph. They average two  transmissions a day and all traffic handled is passed through ZNB, who disposes of the stuff to the local post office and other channels. During their spare time ZNB broadcasts records, of
which they have approximately 9000, between 1 and 2 p.m. and 7 and 9.30 p.m. South African Standard time (8-9 p.m. and 3-5.30 а.m. Sydney time).
R a d io So f i a , B u l g a r i a
Radio Sofia is State owned, the
whole radio service being administered under the name of Bulgarian
Broadcasting System. Radio Sofia,
using a power of .5 kilowatts, is
heard on 7.66mc, 39.16m, and
Radio Rodina, 9-35mc, 32.09m, the
power on this one being 5 kilowatts. Radio Sofia has five broadcasting studios, four of which are
in the central building of Radio
Sofia and the fifth at Radio Rodina.
Bulgaria has well over 200,000
registered receiving sets, which of
course get their programmes from
the broadcast band outlets, 650kc
(Radio Sofia); l,402kc (Radio
Stara Zagora) and l,276kc (Radio
V arna). Advertising over the air
was discontinued some years ago
but is likely to be resumed shortly.
News and talks in English are
given over Radio Sofia from 6.30-
б.40 a.m. daily on both 9-35 and
7.66mc.-—Radio Call.

A special Pacific edition is given
every Sunday by Chester Wilmott
at 5 p.m. It is a survey of the
week’s happenings and as usual
with items handled by Wilmott is
excellent.
D i p l o m a t i c D ia r y
A weekly review of international
affairs, seen from the diplomatic
standpoint, is being given by the
Hon. Harold Nicholson in the
Overseas Services. Mr. Nicholson
— listeners will remember his
analytical commentaries from Paris
on the occasion of the recent
United Nations Conference there—
is well known through his books
and broadcasts as an expert interpreter of the international scene.
"Diplomatic Diary” is heard in the
Pacific Service at 4.15 p.m. on
Thursdays.
L a t e s t L o g g in g s
XO PD , Hangchow, 9.555mc,
31.40m: Heard well at 8.30 p.m.—
'''L.J.K.'''
Radio Kuala Lumpur, 6.l65m c,
48.70m: News in English from
"Radio Malaya” at 9- p.m.—
'''Cushen'''.
C H N X , Halifax, 6.13mc, 48.93
m: News at 10 p.m.— Cushen.
VUC-2, Calcutta, 6.01mc, 49.93
m: News at 10.30 p.m.— '''Cushen'''.
FFE, Paris, 13.715mc, 21.87m:
Has contacts and programme for
New York at 5.30 a.m.— '''Cushen'''.
K N B A , San Francisco, 9.49mc,
31.61m, and K N BI, San Francisco,
6.06mc, 49.50m: Both in parallel
and good at 9 p.m.— '''L.J.K.'''

GVS, London, 21.71mc, 13.82
m: Very good from 6-9- p.m.—
L.J.K .
FHE3, Dakar, 11.715mc, 25.61
m: Has now been dropped in favour of 15.385mc, 19.49m, and is
at good strength till closing at 8
a.m.— '''Gillett'''.

WLKS, Tokyo, 6.105mc, 49.15
m: I must thank '''Ray Simpson''' for
news about this new Japanese outlet. This station is conducted by
the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces and is on the air
twice daily— 7.30-9.30 a.m. and
noon-7.30 p.m. In a letter to Ray,
Signaller Henderson of Station
W LKS says they are not yet operating of a night as so far they have
not been granted a suitable frequency. Station closes following
the playing of "God Save the
K ing.”
KZPI, M anila, 9.710mc, 30.9-0
m: Rex Gillett says "Radio Philippines” is operated by the Philippines Broadcasting Corporation and
is on the air from about 7 p.m. till
after 12.30 a.m. and also again
about 7.15 a.m. (W hilst mentioning M anila, I notice our old friend
KZRH, "The Voice of the Philippines,” is particularly good at 10
p.m. on 9.65mc, 31.09m.— '''L.J.K.''')

==P.39 - New Stations==
'''New Stations'''

CKRZ, Sackville, 6.06mc, 49.50
m: Mr. '''Cushen''' reports hearing this
new Canadian in Latin-American
Service from 9.25-10.35 a.m. This
time does not coincide with the
schedule I received by air-mail
from the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation and which is printed
in full in this issue. But one must
remember it is the prerogative of
A LL shortwave stations to change
schedules without notice . . . and
don’t we know they do it.
A D D IS ABABA, 15.065mc,
19.92m: "Universalite” mentioned
this new frequency for the Ethiopian station and says they are on
the air from 11.15 a.m.-12.30 p.m.
but it is doubtful if they would be
heard here at that hour. However,
'''Ray Simpson''' logged them on this
new frequency at a little before
midnight. Strength was poor and
there was a fair amount of interference, but it is worth trying for,
as frequent announcements are
made in English. So try from about
11.30 p.m. till 1 a.m. '''Ern Suffolk'''
of South Australia is hearing them

weakly from 11 p.m.
------, Munich, 6.10mc, 49.18m;
------, Munich, 6.17mc, 38.62m;
------, Munich, 7.29-mc, 41.15m:
Rex Gillett sends advice of these
new German stations heard by him
from as early as 2.30 a.m. Station
announces, "This is Munich relaying The Voice of the United States
of America, operating in the 41,
48 and 49 metre bands.” Closes at
7.30 a.m. with "Star Spangled Banner.” Arthur Cushen also reports
Munich as good from 5 till 7.30
a.m.— 41 best.
CR8AA, Macau, 9.235mc, 32.48
m: Arthur Cushen reports hearing
this new outlet in Portuguese
China. At 10 p.m. at fair strength,
the announcement is: "This is CR8 A A, Macau Radio Society, on 33
metres, 9.2mc.” English programme
at 11 p.m.
RA D IO OMROEP, Soerabaya,
l 6.68mc, 17.98m: Another catch by
Rex Gillett. Is quite good strength
at 11 p.m., but morse occasionally
causes trouble.
