English writer [[w:E._F._Schumacher|E. F. Schumacher]] published [[w:A_Guide_for_the_Perplexed#Four_fields_of_knowledge|A Guide for the Perplexed]] in 1977 just before his death. In this book he describing his best understanding of the world, including [[w:A_Guide_for_the_Perplexed#Four_fields_of_knowledge|Four fields of knowledge]] for human learning.

This document intents to expand from his explorations, and connect to other authors with similar ideas.

== Four fields of knowledge ==
[[File:Schumacher_four_fields_of_knowledge.png|400px|thumb|The four fields arise from combining two pairs: Myself and the World; and Outer Appearance and Inner Experience]]
The four fields of knowledge are:
# I → inner
# I → other persons (inner)
# other persons → I
# I → the world

These four fields arise from combining two pairs: Myself and the World; and Outer Appearance and Inner Experience. He notes that humans only have direct access to fields one and four.

Field one is being aware of your feelings and thoughts and most closely correlates to [[w:self-awareness|self awareness]]. He argues this is fundamentally the study of attention. He differentiates between when your attention is captured by the item it focuses upon, which is when a human being functions much like a machine; and when a person consciously directs their attention according to their choosing. This for him is the difference between being lived and living.

Field two is being aware of what other people are thinking and feeling.

Despite these problems we do experience a 'meeting of minds' with other individuals at certain times. People are even able to ignore the words actually said, and say something like "I don't agree with what you are saying; but I do agree with what you mean." Schumacher argues that one of the reasons we can understand other people is through bodily experience, because so many bodily expressions, gestures and postures are part of our common human heritage.

Schumacher observes that the traditional answer to the study of field two has been "You can understand others to the extent you understand yourself." Schumacher points out that this a logical development of the principle of adequateness, how can you understand someone's pain unless you too have experienced pain?

Field three is understanding yourself as an objective phenomenon. Knowledge in field three requires you to be aware what other people think of you.

Schumacher observes that relying on just field one knowledge makes you feel that you are the centre of the universe; while focusing on field three knowledge makes you feel that you are far more insignificant. Seeking self-knowledge via both fields provides more balanced and accurate self-knowledge.

Field four is the [[w:behaviourist|behaviourist]] study of the outside world. Science is highly active in this area of knowledge and many people believe it is the only field in which true knowledge can be gained. For Schumacher, applying the scientific approach is highly appropriate in this field.

== Mind, Body, Heart, and Soul== 
[[File:Mind-body-heart-soul_with_schumacher_four_fields.png|400px|thumb|Mind, Body, Heart, and Soul with the four fields of knowledge]]
To add some depth to the four fields, they can be placed in context of other systems of human understanding. I choose the words Mind, Body, Soul, and Heart to represent not the four fields themselves, but each existing in the intersection of two of the fields.

So we can see '''Mind''' on the right, between fields 1 and 4, containing inner awareness, and outer observation, both being direct information a person can work with. 

In contrast I placed '''Heart''' opposite on the left, between fields 2 and 3, containing the inner experience of others, and how others see us, both indirect information you can't know, but can guess by reflecting on our own access to those fields, in seeing others, and experiencing ourselves.

Next '''Body''' is placed on top between fields 3 and 4, as representing the physical world, and our physical senses that gain information about the world. Objective knowledge can be gained here.

Finally '''Soul''' is placed on the bottom between fields 1 and 2, representing nonphysical being, both our own, and all living beings. So all subjective experience is here.

The [[w:Venn diagram|Venn diagram]] intersects the '''Body''' and '''Soul''' circles while leaving '''Mind''' and '''Heart''' as disjointed. This is done to suggest an unbridgeable gap between these two sources of knowledge and awareness that they tend to be at odds with each others. You could say Mind is more connected to rational argument while Heart is more connected to intuitive argument, or Mind to Scientic truths that can find objective agreement and Heart to Religion or mythic truths which use subjective language and symbols which can vary between individuals and groups, and be easily misunderstood since they represent experience that can't be touched or measured.

== King, Warrior, Magician, Lover ==
[[File:Robert_Moore_King_Warrior_Magician_Lover_pyramid.png|400px|thumb|Four masculine archetypes of Robert Moore, with active and passive poles. The [[w:square pyramid|square pyramid]] is viewed here from the top, with integration moving from the edges towards the center or apex. He also saw a downward pyramid as well which existed in ''boy psychology''.]]

Jungian Psychologist Robert Moore[https://robertmoore-phd.com/index.cfm/product/55/king-warrior-magician-lover-rediscovering-the-archetypes-of-the-mature-masculine.html][http://www.masculinity-movies.com/articles/king-warrior-magician-lover] identified four archetypes King, Warrior, Magician, Lover, which he saw as as needed for mature masculine behavior, each archetype containing passive and active poles, and when integrated allow a more mature expression of being. So he saw any one of these archetypes as ''possessing'' us at times, in two opposite ways, and learning occurs when we can see these forces acting within us, and work with them more consciously.

I intuitively connected: ''Magician'' to ''Mind'', ''Warrior'' to ''Body'', ''King'' to ''Heart'', and ''Lover'' to ''Soul''. And these acrhetypes could be considered the personifications of these four domains.

== Keirsey's Four Temperaments of Myers-Briggs ==
[[File:Keirsey_Four_Temperaments.png|320px|thumb|Four temperaments of David Keirsey]]

[[w:David W. Keirsey|David Keirsey]] mapped four "temperaments" (or Myers' Jungian types) [[w:Keirsey Temperament Sorter]], calling '''Guardian'''=SJ (Sensing, judging), '''Artisan'''=SP (sensing perceiving), '''Idealist'''=NF (intuitive, feeling) and '''Rational'''=NT (intuitive thinking).

I mapped these temperaments more directly to the fields of knowledge, with intuitives below, and observant temperaments above. So this suggests the Rationalist works with Field 1, direct experience and self-awareness, like [[w:René Descartes|René Descartes']] [[w:Cogito ergo sum|Cogito ergo sum]], ''I think therefore I am''. Then field 2 is mapped to the Idealist, where awareness of other people's inner experience is important. Next Field 3 is used by the Guardian temperament, awareness of self as a social construct, where our identity is not just dependent upon how we experience ourselves, but also how others experience us. Finally field 4 is used by the Artisan temperament where we use our physical senses and skills to manipulate the world.

== William Blake's fourfold vision==
[[File:Blakeschumacher2.png|400px|thumb|William Blake's four foldvision going from mind, body, soul, and heart.]]
[[w:William Blake]] recognized that there are different ways to experience self and the world, and he gave a sequence to those ways, from lower to higher, and the highest he named fourfold vision. So single vision exists in selfish narcassism that only looks out for ''number one'', while double vision includes the world as we experience it, allowing for the possibility of the tension of opposites. Triple vision exists where the syntesis of opposites produce a higher union within the collective soul. It can also imagine what can be and the will to work towards that. However it is not a place we can inhabit long. We can fall into idoltry there and if we try to stay there too long, we can deceive ourselves in our idealism and sweep away what doesn't fit. So reality can drift away until our vision fails us and we fall all the way back to single vision. But fourfold vision represents another path where we step back from an idealistic union, and accept whatever is.

He expressed this in a short poem in 1802 in a letter to Thomas Butts.[http://www.128path.org/pathtimes/article4.html]
:''Now I fourfold vision see''
:''And a fourfold vision is given to me''
:''Tis fourfold in my supreme delight''
:''And three fold in soft Beulahs night''
:''And twofold Always. May God us keep''
:''From Single vision & Newtons sleep''

Blake calls '''Newton's sleep''' the scientific or rational approach to life that neglects everything it can't see our measure objectively, ''when in doubt, leave it out'', and risking reducing any religious truth as superstitions which can be safely abandoned.

I connected these four visions in sequence from Mind (single self) to Body (twofold - self and other) to Soul (threefold - self, other, and union) and finally to Heart (fourfold, holistic identity as servant and sovereign). This sequence also shows the distance between Mind and Heart. The Mind can see the world in poverty, a zero sum place, where I have to take as much as I can for myself, to avoid the threat of future lack, and from that view, there's no limit to how much you need to accumulate. But the soul and heart way is willing to trust there can be enough for all, and joy is experienced the release of that self-interested perspective.

This sequence also gives an interesting ''weighting''' to Schumacher's four fields, giving fields 1,2,3,4 weights of 1/3, 8/3, 4/3, and 2/3. And the sum of those fractions produces the single (1/3 + 2/3), twofold (2/3 + 4/3), threefold (1/3 + 8/3), and fourfold (4/3 + 9/3) multipliers. And suggests that "other awareness" is 8 times more important than self-awareness. And in our wisdom in twofold vision, its twice as important to know how you're seen as to be able to see. And that may also suggest the problem with narcassism is that we can be shamed by being seen, so we try to present our best possible image, and hide the parts of ourselves which are not acceptable. But those parts don't go away just because we can hide some of them, and psychological projection will make us see the unwanted parts of ourselves in others, and misjudge them.

== The Four agreements ==
[[File:Four-agreements_four-fields-of-knowledge.png|thumb|Connecting the four agreements to the four fields of knowledge]]

I connected them to Schumacher’s four fields of knowledge from my last speech. The four fields divide the knowledge into two divisions – first between self and others, and second between inner and outer experience. 

On the upper left is Schumacher’s third field “How others see me”. We don’t know directly how people see us, and we don’t have much control on this. So “Be impeccable with your word” is what is within our power to be trusted by others. And its also how we show leadership. When we show our care with how we use our words, we are setting an example for others.

And the lower left is Schumachers second field of knowledge “How others feel and experience” and again something you can’t directly know. You can only guess what someone else is experiencing by what they say and what they do, and perhaps contrast it to your own experiences, but it is all guesswork. So “Don’t take anything personally”. And ultimately their experiences are different, so it makes sense that what they do always says more about themselves than you, even if they seem to be judging you. So knowing how to detach from taking things personally is important if you’re going to understand better what’s going on in them.

And upper right, Schumacher’s fourth field of knowledge was “How I see the world” and he saw this as the scientific realm where we can potentially all find agreement in the objective universe, at least to the degree we’re all capable of seeing the world with our direct senses. So its clear Ruiz’s “Don’t make assumptions” fits perfectly within this realm, or at least it’s the place we have the best chance of verifying our assumptions and common facts, and put more attention where others see things differently.

Finally lower right, Schumacher’s first field of knowledge is “How I feel and experience”, and this related to “Always do your best.” Only you can only know you’re doing your best because you are paying attention to how and where your attention is directed. So no one else can judge what you can handle and so this is your responsibility.
