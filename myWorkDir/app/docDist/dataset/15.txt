=''INVITATION''= 
 ''We invite you on a journey of collaboration with like minded agile experts in writing, commenting, and using this open source Wikibook.  The working title is: "Agile Journey Guide".  Because it is a Wikibook, normal Wikibook policies and guidelines apply, which are referenced in the '''Methodology''' subsection.  Therefore, we do not need to reinvent the collaboration protocols. <br>''
 ''The initial plan is as follows.  The first phase is to collect existing links to agile related websites both on Wikimedia and externally to it.  These links will be organized around the initial outline, which is presented in the '''Outline''' subsection.  The second phase will be to identify gaps in this collection of links and write new sections, Wikipedia pages, or independent web-pages, whichever is deemed appropriate by the contributor.  The third and any future phases will be defined by the community of collaborators working on this book.''

= Introduction =
This is a self guided study and practice manual to agile methods.  The initial focus is to cover known topics on agile culture and practices from individuals, teams, scaling, to the entire enterprise, and eventually beyond.  Because it is on Wikibooks we have the ability to keep updating and improving this guidebook indefinitely.
<br><br>
The general audience for this book is anyone interested in agile culture and practices because a Wikibook is an open environment.  The specific targeted audience is agile experts needing a broad reference textbook unburdened by specific perspectives and individual agendas, which they can update themselves.
