This document is a guide to sources of information that may help smallholders in KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) to produce crops and vegetables without expensive inputs.

Smallholder agriculture is practised widely in KwaZulu-Natal. Although low-cost agriculture is unlikely to raise many poor people out of poverty, it can improve household livelihoods This is because most households in the province have insufficient resources to generate a living wage from agriculture, and need other forms of income. 

Smallholders in KZN generally have less than 2 ha (often less than 0.2 ha or 2000 m2) available for crop production. Despite this limitation, there are many successful smallholders; they often produce a variety of crops that may include a small patch of irrigated vegetables, a few fruit trees, and a mix of dryland (rain-fed) crops. There is a great deal of information available to help these farmers, but it is not always accessible. This document is an attempt to show what locally relevant information is available, and where it can be found (mostly on the world-wide web).

== Natural resources ==
The availability of natural resources will limit the choice of crops that can be produced at low cost - Rainfall, temperature regime, soil type and terrain all vary considerably from place to place in KZN. At the scale of the smallholder, the soil and terrain usually require an on-site inspection to determine soil depth, soil drainage and slopes of individual fields. However, there are a number of mapping projects that can serve as guides regarding climate, soil patterns, terrain, and water availability for irrigation at the village or ward scale.<br>

No-till: Guidelines for beginners
This 54-page document is aimed at commercial crop farmers (rather than smallholders) considering conversion to no-till cropping. However, it is included here because it highlights many of the difficulties associated with conservation agriculture and no-till crop production in KwaZulu-Natal. It is available from the No-Till Club of KwaZulu-Natal (the publishers; http://notillclub.com/) and was authored by Aubrey Venter and Ant Muirhead in 2005.<br>

This review indicates that hydraulic lift by deep-rooted perennial plants (shrubs or trees) can help to reduce the effect of droughts on annual crop production in agroforestry systems and promote productivity in some regions with erratic rainfall. Precise measurement of the contribution of the various water fluxes in the groundwater-subsoil water-topsoil water-mycorrhizal-root-shoot-atmosphere continuum is fraught with difficulties, but modelling of important parameters may contribute to the design of more productive agroforestry systems for drought-prone regions.
